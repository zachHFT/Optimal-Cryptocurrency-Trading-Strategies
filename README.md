# Optimal-Cryptocurrency-Trading-Strategies
Statistical Data Analysis of Optimal Trading Strategies (Buy-and-Sell) for Cryptocurrencies

The goal of this project is to proceed to the analysis of an optimal trading (buy-and-sell) strategy for the market of Cryptocurrencies. We expect such a strategy, if sucessful, also applicable to the case of traditionnal stock markets.

(note: Cryptocurrencies data are traditionnaly more easily and freely available than stock markets data, which are often pricey)

The first part of the project will consist in showing you how to access the data of all historical data available on Binance.
We choose Binance because it is one, if not the only exchange, with a properly working API which also have historical data up to 2017 and for the widest range of cryptocurrency pairs, and therefore the most diverse range of applicable trading strategy (arbitrage, sentiment-driven prices, trends, market making, etc).
