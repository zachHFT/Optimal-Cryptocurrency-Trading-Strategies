5,Friendly Advice to use your free awards to distinguish quality posts/comments you find valuable instead of throwing them away in the daily discussion or on auto-mod posts.,Sebanimation,12,ou232f,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ou232f/friendly_advice_to_use_your_free_awards_to/,41,"With the overwhelming amount of posts and comments (30k+ on the daily) the free awards we get from reddit receive more power: We can distinguish posts and draw attention to posts that seem interesting and worth seeing. 

I see pinned posts created by the auto-moderator that get a ton of rewards. Or rewards on the daily discussion post. (not comments in the daily discussion) Those awards are useless. Neither are the posts written by a person that designated their time to create a posts nor are they in need of being distinguished: They are already sticked on top of this sub.

So when you receive your next free awards think twice before you just throw them away at a post you don't care about just to get the awarder karma. Wait with claiming and only claim and use it when you see a quality post that you think deserves more attention.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr: Use your free awards on interesting posts/comments you want to draw attention to instead of throwing them away for some quick awarder karma.",2021-07-29 19:30:51
6,Are you ready for the impending anti-crypto smear campaign?,NevilleHarris,12,ou16eb,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ou16eb/are_you_ready_for_the_impending_anticrypto_smear/,24,"You might read the title and think…impending? Isn’t it underway? 

Sort of, but IMO we haven’t seen anything yet. 

I posted this sentiment in the daily discussion last night but wanted to reiterate because I think it’s important. The war against crypto has barely begun. The people who hate crypto don’t understand it well enough to know how to effectively fight it—which means they’re likely to turn to dishonest personal smear tactics as this space continues to grow. 

Are you ready to be called “bigoted” or some other definition-expanded nonsense for being involved in and holding crypto? Because that’s coming.  Obvious to anyone who’s been paying attention to the state of our political discourse. 

The best way we can fight this is to make these claims undeniably false. Treat people well, teach your friends and family about crypto in an accessible and non-pushy way, and support blockchain initiatives that push humanity in a positive direction. We must make it so that the attacks fall flat due to enough people having direct experience to the contrary. 

TL;DR: The crypto space may find itself in the throes of the culture war more than we’d like it to be, so represent wisely. The world is a battleground of memes and information at this point, and knowing this, we can tilt things in our direction.",2021-07-29 18:45:28

10,"Your Reddit app is also a Cryptocurrency wallet, connected to your profile which is public and could be a potential target from scammers and hackers. Protect your account with a non-SMS, Two-Factor Authentication.",nickpegu,13,otczf0,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/otczf0/your_reddit_app_is_also_a_cryptocurrency_wallet/,31,"**^(Note:)** ^(I had already posted a version of) [^(this)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/osbhhx/daily_discussion_july_27_2021_gmt0/h6p2ny9/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) ^(yesterday on the Daily Discussion thread but I felt it was important to share it with the larger audience as well.)

With so much attention around Reddit community tokens recently, it's inevitable that scammers and hackers will be on the rise and concerns of *privacy and security will be of paramount concern* very soon.

Secure your Reddit account with a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with Google Authenticator or Authy, and this is how you can enable it by logging into your account from a desktop browser:

&#x200B;

>• Click on your username in the top right of your screen.  
>  
>• Select User Settings and click on the Privacy & Security tab.  
>  
>• Under Advanced Security, you’ll see the Use two-factor authentication control. To enable it, click the toggle to on.  
>  
>• Next, enter your password and click Confirm.  
>  
>• Follow the step-by-step instructions to set up your authentication and don’t forget to save your backup codes.  
>  
>• After setup, you may be asked to log out and log back in to your account. Moving forward, you’ll need to enter a 6-digit code from your authenticator app every time you log in to Reddit.

^(\*Source:) [^(https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043470031-What-is-two-factor-authentication-and-how-do-I-set-it-up-)](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043470031-What-is-two-factor-authentication-and-how-do-I-set-it-up-)

\*\*\*

**What triggered me into writing this:**

* I remember in the daily discussion thread that someone wrote about receiving a Reddit password reset request on their email.
* Following this, I randomly opened an incognito tab on my desktop browser to check our sub without logging in and what I noticed suddenly alarmed me. The community points that shines like a badge of honour to the right of every username is visible to everyone who has access to internet—even to the ones who are not on Reddit. And I repeat, no logins required to view the number of tokens you have. Now I know that a person has to visit the token specific sub to see them but it does not even take 5 minutes to link them up with the right place.

**Go the extra mile to make your account extra secure:**

>• Use a strong, unique password.  
>  
>• Use a password manager.  
>  
>• Keep a current, verified email address attached to your account so you can receive security notices and use the password reset system.  
>  
>• Don’t share accounts.  
>  
>• Don’t leave your account logged in or let the browser save your password on shared devices - you can use the [account activity page](https://www.reddit.com/account-activity) to log out of all active sessions.

EDIT: As u/pepperonimilkjuice5 has pointed out, 2FA apps have the option to backup password/passphrases which are similar to crypto wallet secret keys. Back it up by writing it down somewhere and keep it safe.",2021-07-28 18:06:19

Tell me, what first got you all into crypto? What’s some advice you wish you knew when you first invested?


For me, a business class in high school encouraged us to use some fake investment app, just to see how the markets were. Found BTC through there, and definitely did not learn the lesson that was intended. Back before 2016 as well, so I still don’t know why it had BTC.


I wish I was more patient during the 2018 crash. I got bored of my crypto, and really stopped checking till this run. If only I had kept buying I would be in a much different position today. Oh well, not making that mistake again.",2021-07-23 04:23:56

It's not too cultish like other crypto subs and the general sense of help that the community gives is unique in its own. It's my daily escape to indulge in a hobby that I don't share with too many friends. I've only been an avid reader/lurker here for the last few months but I truly do thank the community for all I've learned in that time. 

&#x200B;

Lately, I've noticed a slight decline in the quality of posts that make it to the front page. More and more posts about users simply buying into crypto and letting others know about it, and then commenters coming to cheer them on. Don't get me wrong, I love that more and more people are DCA'ing and stacking their bags, but maybe there should be a limit on how many of these posts make it to the front page in a given week or time period. I'm not at all trying to gatekeep or put others down for their investment choices, but maybe it would be a net positive if we focused on promoting actual news and crypto talk instead of ""I bought $20 of \[INSERT COIN HERE\]"".

&#x200B;

That being said, I still think there's a place for these humble brags. The Daily Discussion thread is already a stickied discussion and would be a perfect place for these sorts of posts. If we were to enforce users posting their latest pickup in that thread as opposed to dedicated text posts, I believe we would see a decent boost in the quality of front page content, much like how memes are no longer allowed their own Image Post.

Feel free to agree or berate me for my idea, I'm 100% open to discussion :-)",2021-07-18 16:29:22

Then I sorted by hot, but it was the same, the top comment have ""have a nice day...."", Really! on a discussion thread that was the top comment. I scrolled (still sorted by hot) I could find only one useful comment, it was about how someone reported some suspicious account to the MODs. Then I thought it's a discussion subreddit, so I should sort by controversial, but the result was yet again same. One only comment that justify that it was a comment on a discussion thread.

54,"How does BTC price affect the activity in r/Cryptocurrency? I collected the data and took a look (This is a long one, so buckle up)",IHaventEvenGotADog,187,oh7vsq,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oh7vsq/how_does_btc_price_affect_the_activity_in/,130,"I recently started trying to predict the Moon to Karma ratio, because how cool would that be?

I figured out that the total karma per Moon round correlates with the activity in the daily discussion threads.

Like this:

https://preview.redd.it/y4tm13i1w4a71.png?width=899&format=png&auto=webp&s=189cf98d79906c94d9b7f24a0afdf70a1b7c8b7e

I thought it would be close, but I didn't expect it to be that close.

Then I wondered how the BTC price activity affects what goes on in the daily discussion.

So I collected all the data. I went back to when Moons were introduced and organised it in Moon rounds, just so its easier for me to graph with other stuff.

I got the BTC price from CMC and took the closing figure for each day, then I managed to get the comment count for each daily since 13th May 2020 (There are some gaps with the daily's as they were deleted or something like that, but its not many and it averages out alright on the whole I think)

# Then I made a fucking spreadsheet, didn't I.

# And some graphs

Here's one:

https://preview.redd.it/5gegpd9gw4a71.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&s=692a50d510c1e5aab0e728cbf6ce2d7debf54e7f

# Yeah of course the price going up will increase activity round here, so what you dork? So I took a closer look.

I graphed each round.

Rounds 1-7 look kind of boring, the same as the market was at the time. I played around with the axis scales and you can see a little bit of what's going on but we'll skip them for this post.

Round 8 & 9 were when BTC started smashing ATH's and shit started kicking off around here.

# Round 8

https://preview.redd.it/y34tevvuy4a71.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c0dbf9627c742c7cd639d57a013ff43c407c176

# Round 9

https://preview.redd.it/wc85fmdwy4a71.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=21ca4f87e93bc53eab6adff2b7063f3eea19df54

This is when we started getting easily into the multiple thousand comments per day in the daily.

# Round 10 

(This one is broken because I couldn't find all the comment counts, so I just averaged them)

https://preview.redd.it/tt3ji3lmz4a71.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f9df09a60d58bde47c15769e64f8f497bfeb9bc

(If anyone has got the numbers for the daily in round 10 then hook me up please)

# Round 11

https://preview.redd.it/le0qsybb05a71.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=191a6b7022d271aafca0efa6819c18dffd2a29eb

This is where the good stuff starts. (If you're weird like me)

I always thought that the price going up would be the major driver in comment amounts. People posting ""To the Moon"" and all the other good hype and mania.

But it looks like its quite the opposite.

It looks like misery really does enjoy company

We get the most activity and the highest peaks when the price freefalls.

# Rounds 12 - 15

Almost every time the price dips a decent amount, the comment count spikes.

https://preview.redd.it/4lxeju0v05a71.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=98874346a2b20098a6fe464e5161d4d46d4db16b

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y5mpv4yv05a71.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e0ea10b36a066131cc2b822b6c5e233172aac15

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y3l2lr1x05a71.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&s=f42a64382b920e0a87f6edba5c0dc5eee3167116

Can anyone remember what happened on 19/05 other than the price dip? That spike is the highest daily I've recorded at 58,550 comments.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bwr85i2y05a71.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cbe4e069aeb63165f59f27e5ae2309525df9d4d

My original idea to predict the Moon ratio is still a work in progress, it uses the daily comment count so it looks like it might be easier for me to just build a BTC price prediction and work from there. For round 15 I predicted 0.292 when it was 0.304, so I was close.

57,Celesti.trade Review,90DayF,1,og3hyj,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og3hyj/celestitrade_review/,24,"So for a newbie like me, who only have whatever coins I have on an exchange (doesnt make sense to withdraw it to a wallet), all I know about crypto is to deposit FIAT and buy coins and keep looking at charts.

But, I thought to try out sending a portion of my moons. And per the reviews from r/cc, I found [celesti.trade](https://celesti.trade) to be the easiest.

&#x200B;

First things first, I sent 10 moons as a test transaction to see if I dont get scammed (always better to be safe than sorry).

I was sending it to Binance, and once I sent the moons from my wallet, I started fidgeting, refreshed Binance a few times. Said to myself, Gosh Darnit u/90DayF, you knew this was a scam. Those 10 precious moons are now gone.

So ofcourse I posted in the daily discussion, and a few helpful ppl replied (as always. They're my fam. )

&#x200B;

And even before I could read the first reply, voila, I see the XLM in my Binance wallet.

Such a straight forward and simple experience. I love it, and hoping to use it in future. 5 stars.

So finally, I sold off a portion of my moons. Hopefully it shoots up the moons price a bit more. Moons to the moon 🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tldr; - Amazing UI, simple straight forward. Even a newbie like me could figure it out. 5 stars. Would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to use it. Hats off to the dev team.

&#x200B;

Edit - Only problem I had was, once the txn was completed, the website did not show me, I had to keep checking my wallet to confirm. I hope dev team fixes this. ",2021-07-08 11:06:20

59,21 Accounts received maximum karma for Moons this month. Let's see how they did it.,TNGSystems,176,ofthyj,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ofthyj/21_accounts_received_maximum_karma_for_moons_this/,336,"I did this a while ago and people seemed to get a kick out of it. It's best done on the day of the snapshot. Go to a user's profile and sort by ""top"" and then ""month"" to see what earned them karma for that month.  
  
**15,000 karma is the cap, which in this distribution is 4,560 Moons. That equates to $376.54 in today's prices.**


The latest distribution snapshot is here:  

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ofss7k/new_moons_distribution_round_15_proposal/

Rank| Method
---|---
1| A couple good link posts and several high-rated comments
2| High volume of comments, top ones up to +150
3| A few top comments that hit the 1,000 karma cap. Lots of other high rated helpful / interesting content
4| A couple top comments and a lot of daily discussion posts
5| A couple quite well upvoted comments and a lot with +50 - this guy seems pretty agreeable ;')
6| I'm gonna call this man ""Captain Reddit"" because he frequently gets top comments in several subreddits
7| I think this user *might* have been responsible for the recent reminder that upvote solicitation is not allowed..
8| A couple whopping front page links and several top comments maxing karma limits.
9| Lots of highly rated comments
10| Has about 30 highly-rated links, mostly about Elon & Doge.
11| Lots of top comments and high-rated comments, averaging around 150-200 karma per. Wowzarooni
12| Again lots of top comments, and possibly one of the sassiest posts I've seen on this reddit.
13| A few high rated comments and lots of low-rated ones
14| Same as above
15| Same as above
16| I think we have a contender to Captain reddit here!
17| Lots of top comments & some sage advice
18| Huge volume of low rated comments and Gif spam aplenty. Pretty much all in the Daily Discussion thread
19| Same as above but with less GIFs
20| Quite a few top rated links and helpful self-posts and an average smattering of 50 karma comments
21| Lots of links. **LOTS** of GIFs  


So that's that then, quite a change from the last time I did this where easily the top way to earn max karma was to post links. Now it seems like only 3/21 accounts managed to get there with links.  

By far the most common method of maxing karma appears to be dropping in a few decent comments in threads. Another change from last time I did this was there were a lot less comedy-oriented comments. **Being genuinely helpful or offering a hot take on the industry seems the best method for success in the Jun-July period.**",2021-07-08 00:17:36

65,A simple solution to reduce sh*tposting in Daily (very controversial),pc1e0,0,oclxo4,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oclxo4/a_simple_solution_to_reduce_shtposting_in_daily/,31,"## TL;DR

**Solution**: Limit the amount of Daily comments per user to 10 or 20.

## Wait, but this limits the freedom of speech

**Wrong!** It encourages it. When you have fewer comments to spend, you deeply think on what to say, so that community can find what you say valuable. Simple rule: the less of something you have, the more valuable it becomes. The chart below will show you that 10 to 20 Daily comments per user is a lot.

## Wait, show me the proof

I studied a big chunk of the yesterday's Daily and found out that number of comments posted by a user correlates with a total sum of comment score they get. I.e., the more comments on average one posts, the more Moons on average one gets. This could lead to more low-quality little-value comments in near future, which no-one needs.

Then the crash hit, at first I was terrified, but my friend thankfully was install there with texts about not to panic and talked me through it. Let me tell you that first week was definitely an interesting one, but I wouldn’t have it any other way now. Since then I’ve been listening to podcasts, reading articles, asking questions and loving the daily discussion with all of you. I’ve been slowly dca’ing in. Buying the dips and continuing to do my research. I’m in this for long HODL so getting to experience that May crash right as I started investing made me realize that I can get through anything and any FUD that is thrown my way.

76,I've figured out a way of predicting (guesstimating) the Moon to Karma Ratio. Of course its on a spreadsheet.,IHaventEvenGotADog,29,o7i7vb,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o7i7vb/ive_figured_out_a_way_of_predicting_guesstimating/,99,"I fucking love spreadsheets. After I collected all the data for the [Moon Metrics Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o23za2/moon_metrics_round_14_all_the_moon_data_collated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I started looking for other data to add.

The number of comments the daily discussion gets could be interesting to look at compared to how the price of BTC fluctuates and the total karma we amass. So I gathered the data and organized it by Moon round.

I'm currently sorting it all through and making some graphs and shit. Should get a post done in the next week.

# Here's a sneak peak of Round 14's graph.

It turns out that maybe misery really does like company. When the BTC price drops the comments peak. I think that big spike was a combination of the Moons distributing and BTC dipping.

&#x200B;

Then I looked at how closely the average comment count in the daily would correlate with the total karma in the sub per round.

Seems like its pretty damn close. I expected it to be close, but not this close.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g8lakwfc7b771.jpg?width=922&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71f09f81df537a12a5e7c69d1438a04e3425fd80

We're just over halfway through round 15 and the current average comment count is 20,075.

So using this metric and some quik maths using goal seek on excel, I'm throwing out a guess that in round 15 we'll get a total karma of 7M giving us a ratio of **0.243**

# If I'm wrong I'll give 10 Moons to the first closest guess in the comments, you gotta use 3 decimal points though. If anyone gets it spot on (to 3 decimal points) I'll give you 50 Moons.

&#x200B;

So as I sat in bed,  trying to convince my partner that $10,000 for a NFT Snoo would be a bargain we can't pass up, I decided to give it a go.

First thing was to see if I could pull the needed data from reddit. I am not a programmer, or anything ever close, so I planned to just use reddit search to find the old daily discussions and write down the comment totals for each day. All too soon I was reminded how awful reddit search is. After being bombarded with..

https://preview.redd.it/5manokz358771.jpg?width=483&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d6e7e7abe44cf1770133f3cf914f700ad097cc9

...I found searching on mobile for ""GMT+0"" was the easiest way to get the results I needed. There are some days in late January that I couldn't find the daily, so that data is missing.

BTC data came from a free trial of [Tradingview.com](https://Tradingview.com) that lets you download chart data as a csv file. The data is from BTC/USD on Coinbase. Everything was compiled in Google Sheets, and below are the results. I am aware these charts would never cut it on r/dataisbeautiful, but there are the best I could do.

[Chart  #1](https://preview.redd.it/5cj0gtlw88771.jpg?width=647&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=057032d55913bf7fb6c2aac52ba9aafeb50808cc)

Chart #1 is BTC price (left Y axis) and daily comments (right Y axis). You can see some correlations to large price movements, but it isn't the easiest to follow. Since comments increase both with a sharp rise, and sharp fall in price, the direction of the lines often diverge.

[Chart #2](https://preview.redd.it/wrjnces498771.jpg?width=644&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8f70b9db236c95ae1f65519a4b7a057822b0a03)

For Chart 2 I thought I would try to focus more on that price movement and graphed the BTC intraday price range (difference between the high and low of the day). This one has a clearer correlation than just BTC price did. I liked the one, but thought perhaps I was overthinking it, so I would give it one more go.

[Chart #3](https://preview.redd.it/ybdh3cyj98771.jpg?width=650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=527f348c26638427ecb8b2f40a4f4fd589ec8109)

For the final chart, #3, I went with BTC volume on the left Y axis. I think this this has the best correlation to comments in the daily, and looks a lot like what everyone assumes it would. It effectively shows when lots of action is happening in the market, comments start increasing in the daily.

**Conclusions** \- Comment count in the Daily Discussion most closely follows the trading volume of BTC. If you jump on Reddit and see a high comment count in the daily, you can assume something is happening in the market. While this is plainly obvious to all, it was nice to see the actual data. I hope someone found this entertaining. If there is any interest I may try to expanded to include 2020 data, but my god I don't want to ever have to search for data using reddit again.",2021-06-24 17:15:32

82,Disqualify removed content from earning moon awards.,CryptoChief,146,o4z3aw,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o4z3aw/disqualify_removed_content_from_earning_moon/,416,"Currently, karma from submissions and comments is counted towards the monthly moons distribution regardless of whether the moderators removed them or not. The reason for this stems back to when the community use to have an event called Weekend Memes. The intention was to count karma even though all meme posts were removed on Sunday at midnight when Weekend Memes ended. 

&#x200B;

Since Weekend Memes was discontinued several months ago, that concern is no longer valid today.  It makes logical sense to only award moons to content which does not break our rules, eg content which isn't duplicated or a rehashed to farm moons. If the act of breaking the rules means you get rewarded, then why have rules in the first place?

&#x200B;

In this poll, I propose not awarding moons to removed content, whether it is a submission or a comment. **If a submission is removed, the comment section will be spared.** Deleted content will not be affected. 

&#x200B;

Since this poll is a [second attempt](https://nm.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nb25pk/dont\_award\_karma\_for\_moon\_purposes\_to\_removed/) to approve this rule change and all polls these days are not reaching quorum, the mods are going to try a more aggressive strategy for drawing out vote participation. We are going to pin a link to this poll in several of the upcoming Daily Discussion threads. If it still doesn't reach quorum by the last day, then we will try pinning links in additional posts on the top page.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/o4z3aw)

EDIT: Fixed link to prior poll.

EDIT2: Just to clarify, we're going give this treatment to future polls as well. Polls will be linked in the Daily Discussion thread and the second sticky slot will be used if it's available. As I stated above, it's becoming increasingly difficult for polls to reach quorum. This may be because more moons go into circulation every month. We might have to fix this growing problem in a future poll.

They are sitting in the Daily Discussion threads and upvoting each other. Looking into some of the suspicious accounts, which I’m not going to mention specifically, the common factor is they write things like “Good morning Brotha” and get 5 upvotes. Other posts like ‘Yep’ get 2 or 3 upvotes. 

They do this relentlessly and over a course of 30 days amass a huge number of Karma points. 

Clearly there is a group of them, or groups of them, upvoting each other to farm moons. 

I presume the rest of the time is spent, lazily downvoting Posts without caring or even reading them, so others will not be able to get attention and their fair distribution. Which means the most interesting information, discussion and discourse sinks without trace. 

This is all conjecture, and hypothetical, though it seems clear, even with the briefest of investigations, this is what’s going on.

I don’t care about moons, I care about the decimation of an otherwise great Sub with downvotes, noise and bullshit! DNB!",2021-06-19 22:26:21

Hello everyone, this is an idea I came up with a few months ago and it is slightly modeled after a previous post quality / comment quality proposal that we had but failed to reach quorum.                   

I work in social media and marketing for my day job and one of the pain points I thought about before with, for example, Steemit, was that the platform did nothing to discourage low quality discussion or people making alt accounts to only engage in upvoting or comment spamming to be awarded with Steem tokens. It has fallen from its hay-days in the top 20 cryptos by market cap, and now it's outside of the top 100, and so to is its hard fork, Hive.                

I took a page out of Lord of The Rings on this one: https://youtu.be/YlrUBFmv63Q?t=68 ""It takes a long time to say anything in old Entish and we never say anything unless it's worth taking a long time to say."" I'd like to modify that here to say, ""I probably shouldn't make a post on reddit unless it takes a moderate amount of time, thought, and effort to say something and convey something.""                

**So, this proposal entails the following changes:**                  
1. We raise the minimum character count limit for text posts to double what it is right now (roughly 560 characters). Any posts that don't meet that character limit should be in the daily discussion thread.                   
2. Users who post 10 comments in various threads with under 280 characters in each comment will only have those 10 comments count towards moon distribution and will have the rest of their comments and posts (for that month) excluded from distribution.                    
3. Users who post more than 280 character comments in various threads are treated as ordinary users and their moon distribution post count will be uncapped.                      
4. Users who intentionally game this system (for example posting 270 characters of the letter ""x"" and then saying, ""Hi guys, how are you?"" or by intentionally posting 9 comments that are under 280 characters, and then making a post or a comment that is above the 280 character count to ""reset"" their comment spam counter) will be banned for one month from the subreddit and excluded from that month's moon distribution.                     

The above is not a perfect solution but definitely requires users to think about what they say before they are going to say it, and therefore encourage more quality discussion than usual. It will also most certainly cut down on comment-spam. When someone creates a post or a comment that portrays a very popular idea, then it would feel just as good as if not better than getting a guilded post at the top of the /r/cc front page.

93,Why you could be making the wrong decisions during a bullish or bearish market.,ArieJ010,3,o0hlt2,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o0hlt2/why_you_could_be_making_the_wrong_decisions/,12,"You know that feeling when everything is green? You're happy, you're pumped and you possibly want to go over to the daily discussion to tell your coin is finally mooning. You go to bed and you guessed it you wake up to a red market. All your profits disappeared, or even worse you're at a loss now. You might get a bit of a negative feeling and you ask countless 'what if' questions in your head. Maybe you start to panic a bit and decide to sell one of your coins at a loss. You have been wanting to sell this coin for a while now, but yesterday it was still going up and making a profit. It would be silly to sell while you're still going up right?

Why are we making so many wrong decisions? What could cause your poor timing of buying the dip or selling the peak? I'm sure many of you have the feeling the markt is against you. When you buy it goes down and when you sell it suddenly moons.

Now I don't know a full answer. However I do have some advice which could help reducing impulsive behaviour. I know the easy solution is to just hold. This is a bit of advice that isn't something that most would think about.

If possible you should consider changing the colours of your candles. Colours tend to influence the way we behave more than you might think. And in this case it doesn't work in your favour. In the article [Color and psychological functioning: a review of theoretical and empirical work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4383146/) brief theoratical and empirical reviews of research are provided of the research on color and psychological functioning.

I won't go in on it in detail, but some results seemed very interesting. I've put the results that seem most relevant in the table below. You can find all results including references in the article.

&#x200B;

| *Area of research* | *Central finding* |*Example*|
|:-|:-|:-|
| Color and Intellectual Performance | Viewing red prior to a challenging cognitive task has been shown to undermine performance | Participants who viewed red (relative to green or gray) on an intelligence test cover performed worse on the test |
| Color and Avoidance Motivation | Viewing red in achievement contexts has been shown to increase caution and avoidance | Participants who viewed red (relative to green or gray) prior to an ostensible intelligence test evidenced greater right (versus left) frontal cortical activation |
|  Color and Store/Company Evaluation | Blue stores/logos have been shown to increase quality and trustworthiness appraisals | Participants rated websites featuring blue (relative to green) as more trustworthy |

&#x200B;

You can make your own assumptions of how this affects you, if it does at all. But changing your red candles to blue can change your decisions for the better. And it doesn't hurt to try.",2021-06-15 17:54:35

106,A $50 experiment,MistrWintr,162,nuzqor,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nuzqor/a_50_experiment/,106,"Based on watching the comments over the last few months I’ve gathered that the cryptocurrency daily discussion is an excellent meter for measuring market psychology. 

I’m going to start with $50 to test this and invest it into Bitcoin when the Daily is filled with FUD. Today is a great day to start. When the daily says the bull is back on, I’ll cash it out and reinvest whatever the profits are as soon as I start seeing bear posts again. Rinse and repeat for the next six months and I’ll keep you updated as to the progress.

Edit: will only be investing the initial $50, cashing out the $50 when sentiment changes, and reinvesting it when the sentiment changes again. No more than $50 will be spent on this experiment. I’m allowed to sell at a loss and allowed to profit, it’s all dependent on sentiment. 

Positive sentiment that will trigger a sell: 🚀‘s 🌕‘s ‘lambos’ ‘BULLISH’ 

Negative sentiment to trigger a reinvestment: ‘bearish’ ‘crypto winter’ ‘what’s happening why is it going down?’ ‘Does anyone know what’s going on’ ‘see you in three years’",2021-06-08 10:16:03

**Guidelines:** 

  - Share any uncertainties, shortcomings, concerns, etc you have about crypto related projects.
  - Refer topics such as price, gossip, events, etc to the [Daily Discussion](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=title%3A%22Daily+Discussion%22+&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).

I have tried searching (both in this community and elsewhere on the net) and read the sub rules, I think this is ok to post but mods, please, delete/move to daily discussion if you feel that is more appropriate. I also didn't see an appropriate flair...

I have two questions I am looking for answers to:
First-
I understand the idea behind ledgers for crypto but what immediately happens after a transaction between two wallets is made? Is there some sort of database (and is this distributed to everyone/stored across everyone?) That has a list of transactions that have been made but not yet added to a verified block in a block chain? For example, Alice has 2 coins, she sense 1.5 to Bob but then quickly sends another 1.5 to Eve before the next block is validated and added to the block chain. How does Eve know that Alice's 2nd transaction should not be deemed valid? Is there an ""unverified"" ledger sitting somewhere?

Second-
I feel I fully understand how Proof of Work validation works, effectively it is a race to crunch hash codes to get a certain amount of 0s at the start of the output. This can't be done algorithmically, it is basically trial and error. Depending on the amount of people trying, the number of 0s required at the start is changed to try and artificially set a standard timeframe for a block to be verified and added to the block chain. In this instance, a single miner ""who wins"" is basically the person who creates the block and gets compensation in the form of X coins. Other people can then easily replicate the work to validate the miner. 

Effectively, power consumption becomes a necessary part of securing these types of cryptos (please let me know if this last statement is wrong).

I keep seeing the Proof of Stake, the validation is done by multiple people but they are only responsible for validating the same % as the stake they hold. I don't understand what that means. If someone had a 3% stake, how do they only validate 3% of the block? Then, how do these disparate validators then join all their work together? Additionally, does this also change the frequency of new blocks being created, or do they still try and create a new block at regular time intervals?

Effectively, putting forward a stake you will lose if you do something bad is what secures this type of coin, which means less power required to secure it (again please let me know if this statement is wrong)m

Sorry if this is basic stuff and/or shouldn't be hosted here. I'm just trying to get an understanding of how this all works. Thanks in advance.",2021-05-24 09:50:38

The daily discussion is full of I lost another 20% should I sell? Well, you should figure out your cost average and if it's money you can afford to not touch for a while. Whole crypto market might dip another 50% from here.

BTC fell from 20k to roughky 3k. So if you compare it to 2017/18 we might have not reached the floor yet.

If you can afford to not touch your money which you should when in investing into something that is that volatile, then don't look at the chart 24/7. Just forget about it and have a look at it in 6 months or maybe even 4 years.

I'm lucky enough to be still up xxx% but my portfolio still crashed 50%. Why panic sell? Learn from the several crashes before: it kept reaching a new ATH.

Stay calm, do your own calculation and rebuy with floor your comfortable with, not because the market dropped 20%. That is nothing as we all should know. It may all go down back under 10k.

Stay safe and think before panic kicks in.",2021-05-23 15:01:32

Some of the people told crazy percentages such as 80%, 90% or even 100%. I was shocked! 

You need to understand that crypto is very volatile (at least in the short term) and putting majority of your investments in crypto is very very risky. 

**You should have three types of funds with your savings:**

Emergency fund

Short term funds

Long term funds

Put a good amount in the emergency fund in case of emergency spendings or potential unemployment. 

You can invest in various other assets for short term funds. Index funds are a good choice. 

Then comes the long term funds and crypto investment. 

You can invest 5-10% of your savings in crypto (recommended minimum) and you have the appetite for more risk, you can go as far as investing 40% of your savings in crypto. 

The ideal percent for you depends on many things such as your liabilities, age and financial goals. But please don't risk all your savings in crypto. Control your greed! 

40% should be the maximum limit and make this a strict rule. Yes the market definitely seems crazy in the bull run and you can get FOMO but emotional investing always hurts. 

**One more important thing people misunderstand is diversification doesn't mean diversifying into several cryptocurrencies. During the bear run, all cryptocurrencies will anyways fall.**

But yes you should totally also diversify your crypto portfolio. Divide your money between established cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH and cryptocurrencies with the potential to moon. 

But what's more important is diversifying outside of crypto too. 

Your crypto funds will most likely give you good returns 5 years later, but there's a 1% chance they may not... And that's why, you need to diversify your funds outside of cryptocurrencies.

146,The many characters of the r/CryptoCurrency jungle,BrownViking99,43,ni02aq,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ni02aq/the_many_characters_of_the_rcryptocurrency_jungle/,52,"Since things are seemingly going to shits, I think a lot of you could use some cheering up. And since I use *way* more time on this r/CryptoCurrency when I really should focus on my upcoming exams - here is a small list of the different kinds of characters I see here. 

# The funny guy

The funny guy is *really* active in the daily discussion, and with 5 min intervals, he usually posts something like *""guys, buy when I sell because it always goes up after I do that"".* This is ~~quite often~~ always followed up by the funny guy nr 2, with the standard *""thank you for your service""* comment. 

# The shill

Nobody really likes him, I mean, other than people who own a sack of what´s being shilled. The shill is like a missionary, or maybe even like Jehova´s witnesses, migrating from their own subreddits into r/CryptoCurrency to spread ""the good word"", but nobody really wants him there. The shill thinks that by his contribution, the market cap of the coin will increase. 

# The law

This guy is the sheriff, and *he will* downvote you. He will be the **first** to comment *""wow this is just a shill""* under every single DD about any project. He will also keep an eye out for anyone looking for upvotes to gain those sweet moons, and usually comment something like *""you are just a moon farmer""*

# The moon farmer

This guy has his notifications on for *every single* newsite that posts *anything* connected to crypto. He is a member of every single subreddit that has something to do about crypto, and he will make sure to copy-paste funny, good, or any upvoted post into r/CryptoCurrency. This guy might also be a hybrid of The Shill and The funny guy, a total nightmare. 

# The HODLer

He will make his presence known, around 20-30 times to be precise on the daily discussion. He has around 100$ worth of XRP in his wallet and will contribute to making r/CryptoCurrency even more of an echo chamber than it already is. *""HODL the line!!!!""* he says, while seeing his portfolio decrease by 40$ after bitcoin takes a fat shit. 

# The Doge holder

Really not much to say about the doge holder other, I will quote him with the most spoken, wise & intellectual words he can speak: *wEN LaMBO*",2021-05-21 20:58:47

There are so many frontpage threads that read like The Sun Newspaper or CNN articles. 

It’s just an abyss for people to post the first thing that comes to their head even if it makes no sense and they dilute their posts as much as possible to earn moons.

The amount of “this is not financial advice” threads and the weird posts with such titles as “if cryptos were Harry Potter characters” is insane.

Daily discussion seems to focus solely on shilling, farming moons and saying “buy the dip”.",2021-05-21 13:43:52

Hilarious and sad at the same time!

People like that are not investors, they’re pussies wanting to get rich quick. (Un)fortunately it doesn’t work that way so you might just as well pull out and never come back.",2021-05-20 20:57:29

I hope someone here can help me with a Binance (non-US) question I have. I can only buy crypto on it via the P2P network as my country's currency is not supported via direct/card transfers. I've of course noticed when crypto prices drop, the P2P prices increase due to the increased demand.

However does this hold true during a bear market as well? The prices right now are insane due to the drop yesterday but I'd like to buy more crypto as well. I don't mind waiting for the bear market to buy more but if the prices are even more higher during the bear market, that's kind of illogical considering most dont want to invest during a bear market. 

Just wondering if anyone has had any experience in this since I'm new to the crypto world. TIA!",2021-05-20 10:03:42

The irony. It is easy to be shilled or influenced, even more, when the market has been acting up like today.

When I've been browsing the subreddit, both the posts and comments on the daily discussion seem to be littered with people telling others what to do. Whilst it might seem permissible because ""haha they shouldn't have listened to some random on the internet"", I think psychologically it's pretty powerful when you have a forum of people generally telling you what to do.

There's people saying it's a bear market, people saying the bull run will continue etc. and, unfortunately, a lot of this stuff is complete speculation - there are people who have invested their life savings into crypto, and this is hurting for them, so rather than shouting at people about how the bull run is going to continue, I feel like it's more appropriate to just admit that we're not really sure right now.

To me, it's a shame that when people mention that they feel like selling, they're treated like traitors who aren't willing to keep watching their portfolios crash - let people make their own decisions without coercing them for personal gain.",2021-05-19 10:40:54

159,Yet another guide for newbies experiencing their first crash... yawn,anon8496847385,146,nemp1u,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nemp1u/yet_another_guide_for_newbies_experiencing_their/,62,"Step 1

Panic, you really can't progress through the stages if you haven't properly panicked. I like to view this like flapping round the house, running your hands through your lockdown hair frantically. I like to imagine your internal voices saying things like, ""why the fuck did I invest 99% of my net worth into Doge at its ATH"" whilst your external voices are screaming. If you are at this stage, well done, you may progress. If you are not quite there yet, look at the charts some more or leverage trade 125x a little bit. 

Step 2 

You need to sell every last bit of crypto you have as soon as it gets tough and dips. This is the easy part, the real meat of the sandwich is you have to tell everyone you sold everything, particularly the reddit sub daily discussion. if you want to cover all bases, I would definitely make a post about how you sold everything and its such as scam. After all, your mate told you he had 5x his money and this got you interested. Then you searched on YouTube ""Cryptocurrencies with 1000x potential"". You went balls deep on pure shitcoins like safemoons and lost 40% overnight.

Step 3

Watch with glee as the market continues to correct a little bit more. This fuels the fire in your belly and reaffirms that you were right about this space, that it's a scam and it's a bubble and it's over. You feel good about this and you post more and more and downvote anyone with even the slightest bit of optimism. 

Step 4

Wait...this can't be happening?!? It's going back up, its climbing, what the heck?!? It's pumping. It's gone above what I sold at and what I bought at. It's a new ATH, it's in price discovery mode. Oh my goodness, this can't go on forever, its only temporary. It's now at 2x what you bought at and 3x what you sold at. You watch with your jaw in your lap and butterflies in your stomach. 

Step 5

You can't take it anymore, you FOMO in to chase your losses and them crazy crazy gains. This time it's not a correction, it's a market crash. It crashes down and down; any fake out is quickly destroyed. Hopelessness everywhere. Months pass and you are down 96% on your investment. You want to sell, but what's the point?

163,Why personal price targets are important,Ap3X_GunT3R,3,ncmkxt,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ncmkxt/why_personal_price_targets_are_important/,7,"Price targets are definitely important. You may not have a specific one, or one set in stone, but you should have a very good idea of what your price target is. 

During the most recent dip, a lot of people were asking in the daily discussion about “timing the bottom”. Most of the time people miss the bottom because of any number of reasons. The biggest being it’s virtually impossible to time without a large amount of luck. And they miss an opportunity to save a little fiat. 

That’s where price targets come in. Price targets can be used to to give yourself the confirmation bias you need to pull the trigger. 

For example, if your price target for Ethereum is $10,000, and its trading around $4,000 don’t hesitate to average in! 

But say you haven’t set that price target in your head. You might waste time deciding if that moment is  a good time to average in or if ETH sees a slightly above average dip, you might hesitate to average in, but that price target could help save you time, stress, and maybe a little money. 

Have a good night everyone!",2021-05-15 02:09:11

179,"Reflections over my Dogecoin journey, and lessons from my own experiences. MUST READ IF YOU ARE A NEW INVESTOR",Memetric,8,n8cuxw,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n8cuxw/reflections_over_my_dogecoin_journey_and_lessons/,33,"Hello everyone!

I thought it would be great to talk about my wild crypto experience these past few weeks.

TL;DR: Be careful what you invest in, and do your own research. All that glitters is not gold, and most members of any large community or trading group do NOT have your best interests at heart.

I was a dogecoin investor who got in a bit late in mid April, bought high and thus had a really uncertain run. I first heard of dogecoin during the GME pump earlier this year, but because I didn't have any money to spare I couldn't get in then. Fast forward a couple of months, and doge hit 0.10 out of nowhere. All the meme pages were in on it, the beginning of the hype you all bore witness to in recent days. I decided to jump on the hype train with a bit of freelance money I saved this lockdown.

It took a whole day for binance to verify my ID, as you might've expected given the volume of new users that month. When I logged into my account on the 16th of April, I was shocked to see that in 24 hours doge had already soared past 0.30. I quickly put in a third of my money, just to test the waters and see where it would go (bearing in mind at this point I knew nothing about buying dips, DCA, and whale activity). Long story short, this was followed by a lot of regretting, experimenting, unsuccessful swing trading, and the infamous 4/20 doge day dip.

All while this was happening, I was lurking on the dogecoin and cc subreddits to stay up to date on the latest news. What I immediately noticed was that the cc members were really bad at predicting doge's peak, because the line just kept going up and would not stop. It didn't crash to 0 after doge day. It stabilized at 0.25. Rose to 0.30, 0.40, 0.50. The dogecoin holders were winning big time, I thought, as I FOMO'd the last of my cash for coins to hold onto as everyone else was apparently doing in the dogecoin daily discussion thread.

I felt quite pleased with my decision, as soon after we had reached an ATH of almost 75 cents. The hype was real, all the media houses were talking about it, we were going to push to a dollar once the dogefather appeared on SNL. Things could not be looking better!

The only problem was the r/cc FUDers. They all talked about how this rapid rise was unsustainable and that we'd come crashing down not too far in the future. I, and most others in the dogecoin community, ignored them. We didn't want any sour lemons ruining our moment.

I woke up this morning to witness the crash of doge before my eyes. With a heavy heart I finally hit that sell button for good, ending my short run with no profits (and luckily, no losses either). The worst part of it all, that I would probably live to regret for a long time to come? In the same time I spent screwing around with doge, Ethereum doubled in price. No wild dips, no influence by random tweets or old TV shows, no mass pumps and dumps by whales. It simply doubled. I lost out on potentially owning twice the money I started off with.

What I did gain though, was an enlightening experience and a lot of knowledge on the cryptocurrency market. Here are just a few of those things I want to share with anyone starting off:

1) Learn the fundamentals of the market. I can't stress this enough. Things like circulating supply, market cap, inflation rate, buy and sell orders, crypto wallets etc. are basic knowledge everyone MUST have before they put their money anywhere. This is the difference between gambling and investing. There are a lot of resources in the daily discussion thread you can check out.

2) Do not fall for the hype. I think this one's pretty self-explanatory. It even says so in the pinned post on the dogecoin subreddit. I'm not saying dogecoin is all hype; there definitely is a place for doge in the future of cryptocurrency given it's value and popularity. It's only that your decision on weather or not to invest anywhere should be independent of the social media shills.

3) Do your own research. Each coin has it's own tokenomics and technology behind it. You need to read up about these, along with developer updates and expert opinions on the pros and cons of each before you can confidently make a decision about the viability and potential of the coin you're holding.

4) Do not trust anyone but yourself. No expert on r/cc or elsewhere could have predicted Doge's wild bull run, and indeed a lot of those under-appreciating it were those who were salty about not getting in earlier. Similarly, not everyone in r/dogecoin who were telling you to buy and hold would have been doing the same. They only wanted you to maintain the price for them while they could sell at better prices.

5) Diversify your portfolio. Given the erratic trajectories of high-risk high-gain cryptocurrencies like doge, and the difficulty to time exactly when certain stablecoins will rise, it's always a good idea to keep your investment in multiple coins. Sure it may not be as exciting, but you'd go to sleep easier knowing you won't wake up bankrupt the following morning.

6) Invest responsibly. Luckily, I got out of dogecoin unscathed. But there are many others not as fortunate as me who have lost thousands in the span of a few hours. I sincerely hope they recover and make profits eventually, but I'd imagine that the sheer stress of watching your life savings disappear as you can only look on helplessly is not a nice experience. Even as I type this, doge continues to drop. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose, do not take loans to put into a volatile market.

This has been a frantic experience for me, and I'm sure many of others too. There are a lot of things I wish I could have done differently, but time is the best teacher and I'm eager to see the horizons I could reach with my new-found knowledge. I've invested my money in ETH and ADA, for those of you wondering. If dogecoin stabilizes and I have some money to spare, I might just put a few dollars in there for old times sake and for the memories it has given me.

Thank you for reading.",2021-05-09 14:03:19

Unbenounced to me, my lovely significant other has been touting our gains to colleagues and aquantencies over the last month or so. 

It all started harmless enough, it came up in a work conversation discussing the topic of doge, bitcoin, and other cryptos. But after a while it became a daily discussion point. Randoms started chiming in and it became common knowledge we are holders.  

Fast forward to last Monday, when I get a txt from my love asking me which exchanges I use. Red flags raised as she never asked before, just always discussed where we are at. I asked why she wanted to know and it turns out a coworker was asking her for which ones we specifically use. I told her an exchange I do not in fact use and left it at that. That night I get notifications for log in attempt on my social media...

I put two and two together fairly quickly for what's going on... sure it could be a coincidence, but I don't screw around when it comes to my money. I told my wife to watch out for that scumbag and not to ever share specific details of our accounts. Also not to click any links he send her. 

I know everyone is excited about what's been happening but this is a reminder to always be cautious about who you share info with. Hackers can get a lot of info about you and if you don't have decent passwords, you may be in for a world of hurt.

Or maybe I'm just paranoid,,,",2021-05-05 18:12:54

195,I scraped and visualised the top comments from two very different daily discussions,MaltMilchek,15,n3bgd9,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n3bgd9/i_scraped_and_visualised_the_top_comments_from/,9,"So, like many of you, I spend my time in the daily talking with and replying to people about whatever is unfolding in crypto that day or whatever I feel is worth mentioning.

Recently, we've had a bit of volatility (!) and for those who trawl the dailies as well, you could definitely 'feel' how different sentiment is during a ""dip"" vs now when prices are flying again and ""we're all going to make it"" again.

I wanted to see what that difference looks like in a visual way, so I spent some time with the Reddit API, python, and some word cloud generation libraries to do this.

# Nerdy Stuff

For this exercise, I crawled two very different threads using a python script and the Reddit API:

1. [Daily Discussion - April 18, 2021 (GMT+0)](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mt23to/daily_discussion_april_18_2021_gmt0/) <- the day of a lot of red and a lot of panic
2. [Daily Discussion - May 1, 2021 (GMT+0)](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n26p8k/daily_discussion_may_1_2021_gmt0/) <- ETH $3k and recent euphoria

Both of these threads had a LOT of comments, so my little old PC struggled a bit to pull down everything, specifically, it had to crawl every comment and reply and save all those comments:

|Thread|Comments Parsed|Time Taken|
|:-|:-|:-|
|[Daily Discussion - April 18, 2021 (GMT+0)](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mt23to/daily_discussion_april_18_2021_gmt0/)  |25,922|94mins|
|[Daily Discussion - May 1, 2021 (GMT+0)](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n26p8k/daily_discussion_may_1_2021_gmt0/) |17,999|52mins|

I decided to make both word clouds a little 'fancy' and reflect what the general moods of each day were using an image mask and relevant colours. 

I also used some additional 'stopwords' that could be excluded from the resulting word clouds, these were:

    gif, giphy, comment, reddit, say, post, crypto, will, going, emote, emo_pack_1, re

I limited the results for both word clouds to **100** of the top words for each daily thread.

# Results

**Bearish Daily**

First, off, lets look at the day of panic selling and fear of the end of the bull run:

[No surprise that 'dip' and 'buy' were very prominent in these results. Unfortunately, 'doge' was also quite a big topic on this day of red.](https://preview.redd.it/8y64dof6sqw61.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec80eca8daabf5edf4afbf67e3a84b4653845d0a)

**Bullish Daily**

Next up, the good times are back, prices are flying, ETH is smashing ahead, and alt season is back on the menu:

['ETH', 'moon', '3k' and 'good' - enough said there, I think.](https://preview.redd.it/a77o3hl8sqw61.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ed90c3eef1457cc6fd3a04ab1f2810f9a95fb29)

\---

I thought this was an interesting exercise for myself to learn how to scrape the dailies and start analysing discussion a little bit deeper to what I've been doing so far (mostly looking at post titles and original posts).

Next steps will be to start messing with some sentiment analysis, but i don't intend to do anything with that process, since I still think Reddit discussion is 'post' crypto activity and not 'pre' any major activity.

This post is the ONLY post you'll EVER need!",Papa-Lou,1,mz806m,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mz806m/a_complete_guide_to_making_money_on_this_sub/,130,"Okay, gather 'round you crypto cadets; this is your farmer captain Papa Lou speaking. This is the ONLY guide you will need to make hella money on this sub. I mean, it's just sitting there for the taking; WHAT ARE YOU DOING IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THIS?!

Okay, let's get started.

First of all, you need to comment, A LOT! Have nothing to add, you say? WHO CARES! Add something, anything. People are WAITING to give you their upvotes, CAN'T YOU SEE?! Have a job? Quit. You need to be commenting and hitting refresh on your browser all day to stay ahead.

Second, you really need to start making crap up, okay? Remember that time you found a hard drive with 10,000 BTC on it? No? Now you did! Remember that time you feed an entire herd of stray puppies with the gains you made from DOGE? YOU NEED TO TELL MORE SOB STORIES! I mean, come on, people, these suckers on this sub WANT TO GIVE YOU MOONS.

Third, you get four posts a day, so here is what you need to do:

1. Find a vaguely written article with a clickbait title and POST IT LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT!
2. Then, make sure you keep an eye on what is controversial in this sub and make a post about that. SHITPOSTING IS MOONS, PEOPLE!
3. ALWAYS remember to post about the made-up story you have, okay? I DON'T WANT A SINGLE DRY EYE IN THIS SUB!
4. PUMP the latest and greatest coin; everyone loves a good pump story!

Okay, now that we got the basics down, here are some advanced lessons for you:

It would help if you were in that daily discussion forum saying the following:

1. Encouraging thoughts
2. How much you love people and this sub
3. That this next project is going to the moon

Watch out for when the new discussion posts go live, and GET IN FRONT OF IT! Don't sleep if it means being one of the first to comment.

Remember, MOONs are trading for like $0.09. You read the stories, you can make a living by following these guidelines, AND PEOPLE WILL LOVE YOU FOR IT!

People love farmers; they feed the world with their cheese moon scraps!

So get out there and make me proud!

EDIT: While this post was intended to be comical, it was so controversial, it was added to the Controversial Club subreddit, haha! How amazing is that? I didn't even know that existed. I'm enjoying the comments, and I enjoyed writing this. Thank you all!",2021-04-26 23:05:17

If you want the hard truth; most if not all of the coins that we are holding right now won’t go to the moon like Bitcoin, they won’t make you the next Connor McGregor or Elon Musk and a lot of them will fall off of the map completely. The only one who I’m even counting on getting close is ETH but even that is a shot in the dark.

Daily discussion is full of people shilling coins like VET, expecting them to skyrocket like Bitcoin not realising that you’d probably have to hold more than 60k coins at this point to even think about becoming a millionaire in the future. 

I’ve been in this scene since 2017 and 99% of the coins that people were rooting for then have fallen into the abyss. Litecoin was called “bitcoins silver” and it is far from it as of now.

Most of us are here for the long run, we HODL like madlads, we cry in dips and we struggle with fomo on the daily. We hope one day we will reach a point where we can retire in happiness.

Crypto is a game of patience and mental fortitude.

1 - Blame americans for the dump, this is one of my favourites and all you need to do is blame the morning dump on americans and tell them to go sleep and blabla 

2 - Tell everyone about your coin that just pumped 1%, the coin needs to be favoured by the community (Btc, eth, bnb, ada, lto etc..) ,so if you talk about some shitcoin you will get rekt (reef, doge, safemoon...)

3 - Bash doge, this is a must really, we can't let doge gamblers and bots destroy this sub!!

4 - Be a Vet, lto, nano shiller but only if the coin is doing good otherwise you get downvoted.

5 - Ask what a moon is, how to get them or 'Moons are pumping today'

6 - Say good morning, this truly works  and just shows the nice community we have here, there is even a german guy that says good morning and beer in the same sentece almost every morning, cheers budy!

7 - Claim to be a chart addict, and the best part is you probably are so you don't even need to lie.

These are the main topics that are guaranted to work so just follow them if you want some sweet precious moons 

&#x200B;

PS:  This is suposed to be a fun satire about the daily thread but a positive one, I really enjoy reading and being in the daily with you guys and please let's never change the content, I love to hear 'Btc is pumping today' and rush to see the charts and the damm thing moved 50 cents but that's the fun of it!",2021-04-21 14:17:58

Looking at the Daily Discussion I saw a few times people saying this is the top and they will cash out. Some people also shared this quote which is the first time I've heard the phrase:

> WHEN THE SHOESHINE BOYS TALK STOCKS IT WAS A GREAT SELL SIGNAL

A few of us are scared and that is totally acceptable. A crash like this isn't great if you have just started, but causing fear and claiming we are going to cash out because you think it's the top is not always 100% accurate. I don't understand this mentality... just because retails are buying into crypto (you and me, grandma, plumber, colleague) that doesn't signal the top whatsoever. There are so many other useful Math-based indicators that are completely ignored.

We should be welcoming people (and that's what we've wanted all along => adoption!), so why do some people have this mentality of ""this is the top, I'm selling and these noobs can hold my bag"". This is not the way (in my opinion, not financial advice, idk I might be wrong)",2021-04-20 10:13:39
228,I don't hate doge coin....,rustyold,0,mueyec,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mueyec/i_dont_hate_doge_coin/,55,"I posted this on daily discussion and this is a repost.

I don't hate doge coins. They are meme coins and might be second most known coin after grandpa bitcoin. Every couple of months in bull run,  they get pumped and their hodler gain some profit. My thought process:

(1). The saying that many newcomers get burnt trading doge coin and they develop lifelong hatred to crypto. My thinking: Obviously some do, but most will read about crypto, gain preliminary understanding and buy functional coins after. If not, oh well, they should have done their homework.

(2). I believe there is no reason to hate doge coin. You don't know the circumstances many ppl and many especially in third world countries enter the crypto scene. Doge is cheap comparatively, bitcoin and ether are too frickin expensive and dogecoin makes sense. $ 70 k is too damn high price (more than 5 times yearly income of a common dude) and it might grow by 30-40% when doge can grow by 300-800%. They can't hodl, they might need that money in next or after 2 month.

(3). Most know it is a gamble but outcome is more guaranteed than a real gamble. Hold $50-200 worth doge, and time will come you can gain $500-2000. That is an impressive perspective. And most guys/gals actually use most of gains in buying more functional crypto. Its their way of increasing their portfolio.

(4). Have you ever considered that you might be jealous and salty; hear me out, please; months of researching coins, reading esoteric papers, watching coin bureau and Benjamin Cowen, buying coins bit by bit and shilling your coin in daily reddit discussion and suddenly some smug bastard who hasn't even heard of ""white paper"" comes, throws some pennies and makes 5X or 10X and here you are hodling top 20 coin that grew by 0.3-0.5X. How dare they? What fucking audacity!! Right? No. Get over yourself. 

(5). May be it's self preservation? May be we are worried that our coins of choice is being diluted, being pushed out of public psyche, being pushed out of top 10, 20 list? May be we are worried that doge is eating our market cap? Isn't it hypocritical? When nano was being spammed, you said this spam is worthwhile as it shows the deficiencies (feeless feature) of nano. Now that doge is being pumped, doesn't it show the emotion driven volatility of crypto? Where is your armchair smug and intellectual discernment of the scenario? Fuck you.

Lastly, I have other grievances but I want you to know that I am very high and you may not believe me but I have never bought or hodl doge or nano ever. 

Let them do what they want with their money. If they had heard you or read about PnD beforehand but still bought doge, its their money. If they haven't, they will soon or they will go away. If this affected you gain with ""proper, functional coin"", its the nature of the beast.

Amen.",2021-04-20 02:50:36

Another way to find information is using the search bar on this subreddit, just click it and search for the relevant terms ''crypto wallet coin X'' and I'm sure someone else already had the same question you did. There's an endless amount of noise on this subreddit with basic questions that can easily be found on the internet. This isn't an attack on the newbies, but real interesting posts now get buried in an endless stream of simple question posts.

Everyone is happy to see their coins going up but be careful of the posts and comments of people shilling their coins. 

There's been some manipulation by bots and discord groups to upvote certain posts and comments to make you see the coin and think it's a good buy. This is especially concerning with the rise of DOGE as it will bring in lots of new investors who only look to this subreddits advice for coins to buy.

As always, do your research. Generally smaller cap coins are riskier and easier to pump by groups. But even the bigger mcap ones have groups that will comment and upvote every post related to their project.",2021-04-18 00:54:43

242,"Using ""moon farming"" for the greater good",glassgwaith,4,ms0926,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ms0926/using_moon_farming_for_the_greater_good/,15,"The purpose of this post is to start a brainstorming about how to utilize Moons as a community in order to promote charity and even - why not - help remove the unfair stain of crypto being used for illicit activities.

I may be out on a limb here, but please hear me out. Let me just preface this by saying I did not  do any research to see if the following ideas have been put forward in the past.

1. I see a lot of posts complaining about moon farming efforts. I understand the sentiment. But what if this subreddit could use the very same mechanic to help charity? 

2. I understand that Moons are not technically worth anything. However, this space is very dynamic and ever changing and in the future they could be worth something. If past experience with crypto is any indication, I do not think I am overestimating the potential. 

3. One of the most used (dare I say by boomers) arguments against crypto is its past history of being used as a means of transaction for illegal activities. This taint I believe is still part of mainstream sentiment. 

4. One way for the crypto space to change this narrative would be to actually demonstrate that crypto can and should be used as a means of promoting benevolent and charitable activities. 

5. The way Moon distribution currently works, if I am not mistaken of course, is that basically upvotes = Moons. Of course, posting sob stories, self betterment stories that appeal to our innate need to empathize, with a view to earning Moons, was bound to happen. 

6. Bear with me, I will reach a conclusion. I am wondering whether it would be possible for charities to be verified and post on this very subresdit. 

7. There could be a set of rules for these kind of posts. Eg.:
a. Only by verified users (I am not sure if this is even a thing on reddit) 
b. A short statement regarding the goals of the charitable organization. 
c. A commitment by said charitable organization that they accept donations in crypto
d. A link to their website 
e. Restrictions on re-posting for a certain time period 

8. These posts would then be left to us to upvote based on our own views and sensitivities. This is in keeping with crypto's democratization arguments. It makes sense that those charities that are in fact deemed by the majority to be worthy of a contribution would get more upvotes. 

Charities would thus benefit from visibility and also they would add a certain amount of Moons to their Vault that could in the future be actually worth something. 

9. In addition, the discussion in the comments section would provide many of us the incentive to actually research said charities as well as their pursuits which would in fact promote transparency as well as increase the reach of charitable organizations. 

10. I realize that said practice could most probably derail the entire purpose of this subreddit if not carefully planned and executed. However, I believe that there are safeguards that could be placed in order to avoid oversaturation of the subreddit in fact turning it into r/charity. Eg there could a daily discussion crypto charity thread. 

PS. I understand that these are all very vague ideas and I am not even sure if they are technically possible / viable / feasible. 

I just wanted to put the ideas out there and perhaps let brighter minds take over the seeds . 

What do you think? Is there any merit to my thoughts?

Edit:another user posted a similar idea simultaneously about a charity bot

I have basically nobody to talk crypto with in my personal life. At least not yet...been working on it and putting myself out there for people to ask questions. 

The real beauties are YOU! Especially the ones in here that have been around for a long time and helped establish this kind of community. Most people on here are very forthcoming with sharing their wealth of knowledge. I’ve only been present in this sub for less than a month and I’ve learned so much from you all. To the point where I am able to help some of the newcomers stepping through the gateway into this beautiful investment opportunity. 

If I can provide anyone with any sort of insight from my first month of crypto trading: trust YOURSELF!! Ultimately in crypto it is you and you only that makes the decision to buy or sell. If you buy in, set a price to buy in and stick to it. If you sell out, don’t punish yourself and watch the charts. Trust your instincts, there will always be another play to make, don’t FOMO unless you truly think there is potential. Stand by your choices and it becomes liberating when you make a solid play, and becomes a lesson learned with you fuck up.",2021-04-16 06:19:37

[Just a quick look at the Daily Discussion a few minutes ago and the result from this thread alone is interesting to say the least.](https://imgur.com/Ddpkzn5)

Would be interesting to hear if the Mods had any stats on these type of accounts or if they noticed this increase as well.

Anyone have an idea on how we could potentially combat this? It's certainly a sensitive issue, as we can't tell for sure which accounts are bots and which are just ***really*** unoriginal posters. Increasing certain standards to post would also effect actual new users, which is something we don't want.

It's however very easy to get caught up in a hype chamber and go in with the wrong mindset, even if the investment is sound. For example on the last daily discussion one of the top comments was ""buy coin x"" with the only reason being ""i'll change the world""

&#x200B;

**Rules:** 

* Top level comments are the names of coins (I will start with a few but please add more)
* Comments under the top levels are the devils advocate, commenting on the problems with the coin/concept and why it may be overpriced 
* The most valid criticisms should be upvoted even if you disagree with them
* Replies to those comments may be rebuttals and counterpoints again advocating for the coin

**Remember BitConnect?** They promised 1% average daily interest, which translates into 3700% APY. And that was the most blatant ponzi in crypto.

If they can multiply money by x10 in a year, they don't need your money.

If you already put money in these thousand+ APY platform, then **get out** before it's too late.

There are no variables on this survey. Just a matter of preference if you were given a choice. Would be nice if you could drop a comment on 'Why.'

259,Where do you think we are on the journey to mass adoption? My take based on the Diffusion of Innovation theory. Links to resources provided.,Papa-Lou,142,mi9p33,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mi9p33/where_do_you_think_we_are_on_the_journey_to_mass/,83,"Hi all, 

I want to take a moment to explain the way I think about where we are in the cryptocurrency space and where we can go from here. To do this, I apply Everett M. Rogers' [(1962)](https://www.amazon.com/Diffusion-Innovations-5th-Everett-Rogers/dp/0743222091) Diffusion of Innovation theory, which is normally displayed in a normal distribution curve, shown [here](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/SB/BehavioralChangeTheories/BehavioralChangeTheories4.html). 

In sociology, innovation is broadly described as, ""an accumulation of many individual items over a relatively long period of time"" as ""no innovation springs full-blown out of nothing: it must have antecedents (events that come before the innovation)"" [\[1\]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1249295.pdf?casa_token=dNo2BCm7fukAAAAA:coPOOV1bE5UbGiL6r10SuQ2XdbNF8l3AbqSownNsrQeNAqnyReUfVtlfQ9V4HqDx3Oqx5tkX_3seUiYSoIcRfXbVS89cnJN40Oq2pTPHz_URp4ODcgLI). 

So in terms of cryptocurrency, I think we all know that the 2008 fiat US financial collapse was the antecedent to the Bitcoin whitepaper written by Satoshi Nakamoto [\[2\]](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). This was the initial innovation, combining cryptography, digital signatures, and the proof-of-work mentality, ideas that were applied for other uses, into a new idea of a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash. 

This initial innovation is where we begin on the diffusion of the innovation curve. 

[Diffusion of Innovation Curve](https://preview.redd.it/rxb4rnp36mq61.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=91b0ed6a6a9069b2ab9d933dc5f2b8d2f9c2c67e)

So Satoshi Nakamoto is BEFORE the 2.5%, the creators of any product or service development. Next is what follows based on this theory. 

**I would be interested to know where you all think we are based on this theory:**

**Innovators:** These individuals are those who seek out and embrace new innovations, and are not afraid of the risks associated with the new idea [\[3\]](https://search.proquest.com/docview/197971687?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true). Here I like to think about the ""Bitcoin Pizza"" guy and all those tragic stories of those who have lost hard drives containing hundreds of BTC on them. These were people who were taking on the risk of a new idea, regardless of where it could have gone. These individuals need little if any information to come on board if the idea sounds good to them [\[4\]](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/SB/BehavioralChangeTheories/BehavioralChangeTheories4.html).

**Early Adopters:** These are the individuals who are open to change, but respect the social system that surrounds them. This means that they are a bit more risk-averse than their innovator counterparts but adopt new innovations more willingly than the majority of their social system around them [\[3\]](https://search.proquest.com/docview/197971687?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true). It is at this point that people like ""social media influencers"" begin to come on board, sparking interest and encouraging more adoption. It is also at this point, that I believe, this subreddit was created to build a community of those who are also early adopters of the new idea. 

**Early Majority:** The early majority makes up about 1/3 of the marketplace within a specific system. These are your ""average"" members of society, those that come on board when it becomes the ""cool thing to do."" These individuals typically need to see some evidence that the innovation works, and there is some staying power to the new idea [\[4\]](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/SB/BehavioralChangeTheories/BehavioralChangeTheories4.html). This is where your friends start to come on board, one by one. They begin to see your success or happiness using the new innovation, so they inquire about your new development. 

**Late Majority:** While early adopters tend to be younger and more familiar with technology in general, the late majority are those of the population that is older and more reluctant to adopt the ""latest trends"" [\[5\].](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diffusion-of-innovations-theory.asp) These individuals tend to need a lot of examples of success stories regarding innovation in order to jump on and accept the new idea in their everyday life. This is when parents and distant family begin to adopt the innovation after much nagging and conversation. Think about when parents first started to adopt social media years after their children were using it every day. 

**Laggards:** These individuals only try new innovations when fear and pressure push them to do so [\[4\]](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/SB/BehavioralChangeTheories/BehavioralChangeTheories4.html). We saw this in full force when COVID disrupted everything and the laggards that owned businesses and who refused to have a website, refused to have a social media presence, and refused to participate in online ordering, were forced to change based on the fear of losing their business and the pressure to ""get with the times.""

**TL;DR**

So, by strictly applying this theory in the cryptocurrency sphere, I think that we are between the early adopters and the early majority. Right on the line that divides them. For the past couple of weeks I have been polling those in the daily discussion threads and gathered the following:

1. Many of you agree that crypto is in the early stages. The majority of you have friends and family that are still skeptical, and most of you are investing alone as those you talk to will listen, but are not ready to jump on. 
2. Many of you seemed to agree that crypto is still difficult to ""get into."" Difficult to transfer, buy things with, and properly store. 
3. However, we have all seen the headlines, companies like Tesla, PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard are all coming on board. CNBC now regularly talks about Bitcoin, and the concept of BTC is creeping into the news cycle every day. 
4. Yet, Bitcoin is about as far as the news goes when talking about cryptocurrency. Only Reddit, YouTube and blogs will talk about ETH or ALTs in general. 

All of this leads me to think that we are, in fact, making our way to the mainstream adoption, and can all take pride in being part of the small group that finds an innovation before the masses and reaps the benefit of shaping that innovation as it grows, and are on the forefront of a technology that will shape our financial space forever. 

Thanks for sticking with me. 

Looking forward to your thoughts.",2021-04-02 03:13:11

Probably not, but it begs a paltry attempt at least.

- Heavily shilled (at least every other post) = sell or don’t buy.
- Moderately shilled (once in a dozen comments or thereabouts) = hodl.
- Lightly shilled (just once every now and then) = strong buy signal.

This is financial advice. I love you.",2021-04-02 02:23:55

""Oh God, why did I not move my {insert coin} to {insert coin that is pumping}. I would now have X times as much money.

Well, if we knew how the future was going to play out, we would all be rich, everyone would buy into the coins that were going to pump and make sick gains. But that's not how the market was. What if you moved from one coin to another, and then the coin you moved it to tanked 50%? You would also beat yourself up. So, we beat ourselves up if we lose, we beat ourselves up when we don't win big...

Yes, we are all human, we all feel emotions. But what about you simply sticking to your guns, sticking to the coins you did your research on, instead of going to the ""Biggest winners/Biggest losers"" tab on any given website, and just accept the gains/losses you will have.

Again, it is so easy to trade in hindsight, just pick your coins, and stick to them until you don't feel like owning them anymore (idk, maybe taking profits, or whatever).

And remember. The average investor is happy with 10% ROI. Imagine us being sad that BTC is *only* up by 300% since the 2018 high...yeah...

Have a great week everyone.",2021-03-14 22:53:11

I'm a Data Science student with some experience in text analysis. Since I'm always browsing this sub, why not put the two together I thought.

I'm building a website which will contain all the results of my text analysis in this sub, and will be free for everyone to use. 

So here's my idea of data that could be interesting:

* daily number of comments and posts
* the number of times each coin is mentioned in the daily discussion, each time analyzing if the sentiment is positive or negative.
* analyzing the whole series of comments to see if the market sentiment is ""fearful"" or ""greedy""
* comparisons of trends in here with the market, seeing if there's any correlation

Is there something else you would like to see? Or any Ideas really :)",2021-03-14 09:15:17
278,PROPOSAL — Downvotes don’t count negatively for moon distribution,ImJustReallyFuckedUp,3,m4q4z8,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m4q4z8/proposal_downvotes_dont_count_negatively_for_moon/,75,"In many posts, including the daily discussion, I see full threads downvoted for absolutely no reason. People do this for the sole reason of making their comment/post viewed more, because reddit shows downvoted comments at the end of the list of comments. One choice would be for reddit to change how upvotes/karma and things like that work, but they probably wouldn’t want to do that before coins are rolled out across all of reddit. So, I think we should at least change it so that these downvotes don’t count negatively for moon distribution. Rather, moons should be solely based on upvotes, negating all downvotes.

People can’t even comment their opinions, scared that they’ll lose moons for no good reason.

281,How to keep the subreddit healthy and also learn stuff on the way!,UrMuMGaEe,13,m3mj88,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m3mj88/how_to_keep_the_subreddit_healthy_and_also_learn/,39,"We have seen a huge influx of new users and also the sub has changed radically in aspect of rules, polls and also more importantly content! Although many have addressed some issues, I wanted to make a list of what I think are the things we as users can do to keep the sub healthy while also learning more to better understand crypto. So here it goes..

&#x200B;

* **Sort by new occasionally even if you spend more time in hot.** This makes the content on sub more varied and also allows more exposure to new posts. Although good new posts obviously make it to hot, you basically are reading the majority agreed post. Maybe a bitcoin maxi post has reached hot while a post on same upcoming bitcoin upgrades died in new.

&#x200B;

* **Participate in the community polls.** This is very important for everyone to take part in, by voting you are helping yourself, and fellow users in making a decision literally in ""by the people, of the people, for the people"" way. Make your voice heard.

&#x200B;

* **Participate in the daily discussion everyday.** If you observe, daily discussion is being given very low attention (based on comments). Daily discussions are the place to ask questions, help someone out or even greet someone. Posts with low character count are rejected as the place for them is in daily discussion thread. People in daily discussion might even point you out to any anomalies (Like an absurd withdrawal fee hike on an exchange) faster than any main page post that might reach you slow.

&#x200B;

* **Participate in the skeptics discussion.** This is important than daily discussion imo. All the unpopular opinion posts which are now the most upvoted ones should actually have to be in the skeptics discussion thread. This is the place to ask, prune and verify your doubts/ ideas/ theories you have on your investment or something you have been eyeing to invest in.

&#x200B;

* **Use both upvote and downvote buttons.** Although this seems obvious, people are not using the features. IMO, If you like something or something gave you a grin, you **upvote**. If you don't have an idea of what OP is saying and need any clarification or want to leave a message or even express your version you **comment**. BUT, if you don't like something or you believe someone is karma farming or against this sub/your POV, then for god's sake **downvote**. Downvoting posts makes the sub as a whole tune it's content and also discourages users from not making the same posts (If majority downvote). I myself made shitty comments and received downvotes, but when I post random maxi predictions (that are literally shitty/karma farming) people called me out in comments but NO ONE DOWNVOTED my post. This gives me a feeling that I can try out my luck and post shit I want to farm karma and also avoid downvotes.People argue the new ""Crypto changed my life"" posts are just karma farming, then did you downvote such posts? Then how can people tune to that version?

&#x200B;

* **Try not to be an echo person**. Although being one fetches more posts and in turn more karma and in turn more moons to you, if you see the big picture..you might be missing an ""Aha"" moment due to lack of questioning nature that might make you find your next moonshot. There are also many skeptic users here who will take your comment to next level if it's legit and fruitful discussions start.

&#x200B;

* **Try to understand technical posts more.** We all see people using technical terms and charts. Although not all are legit, it suggests that the person has took the time to explain stuff and has some real data to back his/her/their voice. If you can't comprehend what it is..look in the end for TL;DR or even comments, someone might have asked/clarified about it. Constantly gulping in only news/ debate content doesn't have much impact on your investing powers. Getting technical  although doesn't guarantee 100x, it helps to understand markets from a different POV.

&#x200B;

* **Have a special corner for educational/discussion posts.** Although this seems biased, educational posts create more fruitful debates and teach something new to OP and also the users. You learn something new too and also some skeptical discussion will definitely be running down in the comments. Reading that single segment will set you ahead of reading tons of news articles.

&#x200B;

* **Don't concentrate too much on moons.** I'm not saying don't participate and get rewarded. What I'm saying is, in the process of trying to farm moons people lose their genuine views/ideas which are really the things that fuel this subreddit. Think about it, you see the top posts are now related to a particular news/coin and try to jump in and make a post related to same thing. And your post will be lost in a horde and you wonder what's wrong. If you didn't become the echo chamber and posted the real/your genuine POV idea, it might have been the real content that might attract people's attention.

&#x200B;

* **Take a break.** Don't spend too much time on subreddit and even portfolio apps. Our time and days are numbered. Just give a set time to crypto and related stuff and then get off the grid. Make alerts on the portfolio apps and forget about it. We all know most of us just panic at the lows and excite at highs, but we never intend to sell. So why care right now?. All the gains and moons are to make us happy, by being happy right now in this moment in your life..you are getting the most out of it. Just chill and don't spend too much time on the sub or markets.

I believe I covered what I wanted to say. If anyone knows me from previous educational posts, you know I'm a point based guy lol and if there's any point that you guys believe I missed or would be nice if added...just comment it down below and I'll try to edit it here.",2021-03-12 18:30:34
282,Please don't fall for and sell based on Binance FUD,mickhah,2,m3jblm,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m3jblm/please_dont_fall_for_and_sell_based_on_binance_fud/,25,"Hey guys and girls, 

This is my first and only time posting a thread it's not for karma or anything just a bit of advice, even if it only reaches a few. 

I am posting this as a thread rather than the comment I originally put in the daily discussion to hopefully get more visibility and help calm people down. 

If you think the biggest crypto exchange in the world isn't extremely compliant with US regulations it is short sighted. If US users use a vpn to trade around binance.us that is not for the company to decide as they must deal with the fact an ip from another country has used their service. Binance are strict with VPN use but members can slip through the cracks as with any company. The users using vpn services are in the wrong, not binance. I'm not a binance shill but work financial compliance for a corporation and just telling you how this would play out with us.

I hope you don't sell this dip and use it as a chance to buy if anything! Remember the fud dip not too long ago when a Korean exchange was raided and that was much bigger news, we returned to normal after 2/3 hours.

Tldr; buy, rather than sell and lose Sat's on baseless fud.

Edit* I doubt this will get rewards too but if some person was actually thinking of awarding this please don't there's many charities that need funds now more than ever",2021-03-12 16:01:21

But moonfarming for posting a link to an article is ok?  
There is no big effort for posting a link!

  
People will always find ways to abuse something for their own profit.

I don't care if people post memes, stories or whatever,  
Posts should require flairs IMO, that's all.

These types of posts are bad enough, but when you get 100's of them a day, it's just the same thing over and over

Any posts like that matches the criteria is simply removed by the mods, with a message to say to keep stuff like this in the daily discussion thread

288,People complain about everything on here,Cristian7x,6,m1k5jp,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m1k5jp/people_complain_about_everything_on_here/,40,"I might get downvoted to hell, but I just have to say that a lot of people on here complain about pretty much anything. For the past how many ever months, people complained about how sharing memes was “moon-farming”. I get it, yeah, that makes sense. However, I just saw a post on here that was someone complaining about how this sub is now all personal stories and anecdotes!? C’mon, man. Where is all the hate stemming from? 

People called for posting to a different subreddit for memes, which I completely understand, but now y’all want things to be posted to a subreddit “how crypto saved me”? I hate to rant, but, man, that’s insane. 

At this rate, people will be complaining about the daily discussion post. In a few weeks this subreddit will be completely split into a bunch of other subs because of people complaining about everything. 

We all share a common interest on here: crypto. If you don’t want to look at personal anecdote posts, scroll away. If you hate memes, keep scrolling. There is quality content on here, you just need to scroll past the things YOU don’t want to see and find what you do. I personally feel like this should be an all-inclusive sub. There are too many huge egos on here and that’ll be the downfall of this sub if people don’t stop complaining about everything. There’s a reason why this sub is called “cryptocurrency” and not “Crypto(insert specification here)” There are rules for things that mods and others have deemed fair and as long as you’re not violating them, I don’t get why every post has to be redirected to a different sub.

Rant over, I guess.",2021-03-10 01:02:11

290,A bot that tells you the amount of karma you got on this subreddit since the last moon distribution,zzaann,17,m18ral,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m18ral/a_bot_that_tells_you_the_amount_of_karma_you_got/,30,"**Bots on Reddit are nothing new**. We all probably know some such as the *!RemindMe bot* which is one of the best-known comment bots which reminds you of a post in the amount of time you specify in the comment.

**I often wonder** how much karma has I got in this subreddit since the last distribution, which would then help me predict **how many moons will I get** in the next distribution. Even tho you can't know how much each karma will be worth, you can predict it based on the karma worth from the past months - **but you can't see how much karma have you got** until a few days before distribution.

So, why not make a **!MyKarma bot** or something similar that would reply with the amount of karma you got in this subreddit *since the last distribution* and maybe even *your total karma* for the sake of throwing a house party when you reach certain milestones.

We might also like to add some rules such as the bot only working on daily discussion threads (or something similar) to avoid spam and that each user has limited times that they can use a bot (once per day maybe, again, to prevent spam).

Maybe to some of you, **bot seems like too big of a deal.** Then maybe we can provide this data in a simple **post similar to the one we get before distribution** (with a list of all usernames and received karma), but with the difference to show **weekly stats for each user**, so people could track their karma progress on weekly bases at least, not just to be hit with a number at the end of the month. Post like that could be posted on let's say Monday and would include all the karma you got in the past 7 days (another row for the karma since the last distribution would be nice)

**Some people look at moons just as a joke**, some just as a *community token*, some use it for *beer money* and some people even use them to *pay for their rent* once in a while. My point here is that there are a lot of different people in that community and **some of us might actually find their karma stats pretty useful.**

The only concern I have is that a bot or weekly post might attract even more moon gatherers, which might not be the case after all but concern is concern.

296,My take on LTO Network: the ultimate criminally-undervalued alt,veegred,120,lwowyw,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lwowyw/my_take_on_lto_network_the_ultimate/,37,"I’ve seen LTO increasingly being mentioned in the daily discussion but I haven’t seen many posts talking about it so I thought I’d share my thoughts. **This is, however, not investment advice, just my conclusions from reading about LTO, watching webinars, reading AMAs and generally being involved in the community. As always, DYOR.** I’ve included a TL;DR at the bottom for those of you feeling lazy. 

-

LTO has some of the highest adoption in crypto. It is the top #197 by MCAP but it’s a top 10 blockchain by number of transactions (120k per day, with a steady 25% growth MoM).

The reason why it has so many transactions is because they already have quite a few clients using it, and some big ones (for example, the UN, with land registry projects in developing countries like Afghanistan) are yet to start properly anchoring transactions on the network, something which will only increase the number of transactions especially as similar solutions for more countries are rolled out. 

Before you accuse me of this being yet another shill of some ‘great tech’ destined to flip Bitcoin or Ethereum, I’m not specifically talking about its tech, actually. I’m talking about actual adoption and clients and a money-making business that does not rely on speculation to provide value. Txs on the network and their fees are paid by actual clients that are getting BaaS (Blockchain-as-a-Service) out of LTO. There’s enough ghost chains with ‘great tech’ and ‘potential’ and negligible number of transactions/usage valued at billions of dollars. A lot of projects get built in hopes that they will attract customers. LTO has done it the other way round, focusing on business and adapting the tech to meet the needs of its clients.

-

**But why buy LTO tokens?**

You might be wondering what these do and how they are used in the ecosystem. 
LTO tokens are used to pay for transactions and smart contract fees. So far, almost 100m have been burnt, what makes LTO deflationary. In fact, 11,000 tokens are burnt on average every day, since txs cost a fee of .35 LTO, of which .25 is for nodes and leasing rewards, and .1 is burnt. This translates to about 3.4 million tokens being burnt every year at the current rate, out of a maximum supply of less than 400 million. You can stake the tokens by setting up your own node or lease them to an existing one (since it’s a proof-of-stake blockchain), and contribute to decentralisation and the security of the network, thereby earning LTO tokens. The staking currently earns you 7% APY, but this could go up based on tx growth and it is done through the LTO Network wallet. Tokens are also used for governance, allowing node operators to vote on network proposals. 

-

**But how can investors benefit from buying in - would a high token price be good for clients? Surely the team would want to suppress the price so that they don’t lose business?**

Let’s say, for instance, that the price of LTO goes up a lot in a short period of time. Nodes can then vote to lower the transaction fees to accommodate for a higher token price to keep the price low for customers. Customers can, however, just run their own node to contribute to the network and get a share of the rewards or use a validator to handle all that and not be impacted much by a rising price since that’s all factored into their business agreement - paid for in fiat for a flat amount. A lot of clients do not want the hassle of dealing with tokens or nodes - and that is perfectly fine since they don’t have to for LTO to provide their services and for us to benefit from their transactions. The team, in fact, has a portion of the total supply locked until the price reaches an acceptable (I.e not undervalued) level and they can use the funds for mergers and acquisitions with/of other great projects to add value to customers. Recently, VIDT was acquired in order to provide verifiable identities as part of the LTO product offering.

-

All of this, if anything, leads to the logical conclusion that LTO is criminally undervalued, especially when you compare it to other projects that are basically ghost chains with zero clients or adoption, and just promises and price rises tied to speculation, hype, and FOMO. LTO’s mcap is currently $105 million, currently trading at about $0.38, and its ranked at #197 by mcap. To put it into perspective, at HOT’s (Holo) market cap, top 100 on coinmarketcap), LTO would be worth $1.66. At VGX’s (Voyager Token), top 50 on cmc, it would be worth $5.39. At BCH’s (Bitcoin cash), top 10, it would be worth $36.20.

LTO just needs more exchanges and more recognition, but you can currently buy it on Binance if you have access to it. People in the US can also buy it, it’s explained [here](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/LTONetwork/comments/lhuxys/buying_lto_in_the_us_cheap/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf). This is not ideal, but the team is actively working on getting more listings and we should get some updates on that soon. This should only lead to more buying pressure and visibility. The fact that the Binance LTO wallet keeps getting drained day by day is a great indication of where LTO is going and destined to be.

I’d be interested to hear about any FUD/concerns about LTO because I haven’t found any since I started investing. I would also be interested to know about other undervalued projects with so much going for them in a way that would compare to LTO.

**TL;DR** - LTO is a b2b blockchain that already works and is being used with growing txs every day by big clients. It has a lot of growing potential due to a small market cap and it not being listed on a lot of exchanges yet, good tokenomics due to its deflationary nature, staking rewards, and an actual use case for the token.",2021-03-03 09:24:16

With each moon distribution round, it becomes harder and harder to keep up with which proposals have passed. We have reached round 10 distributions, and I think it would be helpful to have more visibility around the distributions that have been passed and implemented. This can be done with a ‘sticky’ thread or by creating a ‘Passed Moon distribution proposals’ link under “Useful Links” in the daily discussion. 

I’ve seen a lot of questions asking about the new rules regarding moons. As the community continues to alter the structure around moon payouts, it becomes very difficult to remember all of the changes. 

**tldr; I propose we create a link or sticky that lists all of the moon distribution proposals that have passed in order to keep up with the changes.**",2021-02-26 20:27:06

One other thing that the crypto space lacks - in the eyes of institutions - is **regulatory certainty.** 

And on the other hand, we have Papa Elon, who recently self-proclaimed himself Elon Musk of House Dogecoin, the First of His Name, King of the HODLers, Staker of coins, the Father of Bitcoin, the Owner of Diamond Hands and Chief Meme Creator of Cryptoland.

Even though Tesla's investment announcement came at a very fortunate time, I think Musk should let things consolidate, stop tweeting about Dogecoin 24/7 and focus on getting us to Mars by 2030 instead of pumping crypto prices like he didn't have a thousand better things to do. 

But I guess he has a good laugh at price movements before he goes to sleep on his million-dollar bed.

And we have our Daily Discussion topic to rant about him while he sleeps.

312,DCA vs buying the dip vs lump sum investing in crypto,nounounou,11,lrcuyc,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lrcuyc/dca_vs_buying_the_dip_vs_lump_sum_investing_in/,11,"First of all I'm not an expert and I post this mainly to create an open discussion here. This is of course not investment advice, and only for educational purposes, you know the drill. 

In the daily discussion I see DCA (dollar cost averaging) and buying the dip being mixed constantly and they are not the same thing. 

For DCA you buy the same amount at fixed intervals (weeks, months) over a long period of time (years). You do this to overcome the volatility in the market. 

Buying the dip is much more subjective. You have to make a judgement yourself what qualifies as a dip. How often do you buy the dip? You can run out of your reserves quite fast if you buy each time there is a pullback of 5 percent. What do you do in a bear market? Is it even worth investing in a bull market at all? In crypto a dip is often the value of a few days ago, why didn't you just invest it all in the beginning if you had the money available then?

That brings us to the third investment strategy, lump sum investing (LSI), where you just buy everything in one go. I'm going to compare this strategy to DCA for a few scenario's. Due to the subjective nature of buying the dip, I can't make a proper comparison with that strategy. 

You can try it out yourself here: [https://www.costavg.com/index.php](https://www.costavg.com/index.php)

If you would have bought BTC a day before the peak of the previous bullrun:

* DCA would bring a ROI of about 550%
* LSI would bring a ROI of about 150%
* If you would have bought BTC a month before the peak of the previous bullrun: 
* DCA and lSI would both bring a ROI of about 550%
* If you would have bought BTC 2 months before the peak of the previous bullrun: 
* DCA would bring a ROI of about 550%
* LSI would bring a ROI of almost 800%

So you see that DCA brings you much more consistent results, but the results are only better than LSI if you would have bought within a month of the previous bullrun top.

It is a different story for alts. On the same link you can also do a simulation for ETH, LTC and XMR

Ethereum is the best performing one of these 3 and I'm going through the same scenario's as for BTC:

* Start at the 2018 peak:
   * DCA ROI: 620%
   * LSI ROI: 52%
* Start a month before the peak: 
   * DCA ROI: 606%
   * LSI ROI: 156%
* Start 2 months before the peak:
   * DCA ROI: 608%
   * LSI ROI: 411%
* cross-over point where LSI starts to outperform DCA: 4 months before the peak

So again you see that DCA gives consistent results, but it also outperforms LSI for a longer period. Only if you start  more than 4 months before the peak of the bullrun LSI would outperform DCA. For LTC and XMR this is even longer. The reason is the higher volatility of alts. This could indicate that if you start investing in a bullrun, like the one we are in now, and you want to invest in alts, DCA would be a smarter choice than LSI. 

TL;DR: DCA is not the same as buying the dip. DCA and LSI were compared as investment strategies for crypto. LSI seems a better strategy for BTC, as long as you don't buy near the absolute top of a bullrun. DCA seems like a better strategy for alts (you have to start investing already several months before the  top of a bullrun for LSI to give better results)",2021-02-24 14:27:08
313,Something to think about - Keep an open mind,Anjz,7,lr0sio,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lr0sio/something_to_think_about_keep_an_open_mind/,5,"Something I posted on the daily discussion but decided to add it in here.

Picture this, it is early-mid 2016. Being interested in the recent growth I'd watch the discussion threads here and there but was not fully invested. A new coin started popping up in mentions here and there called Ethereum. Believe me when I say, during that time a lot of people were like 'Oh what a stupid name, it will never catch on, it doesn't even have coin in its name.' They only had Bitcoin on their mind and at that point it was still useable to transact with. Fast forward to now, Eth has hit a marketcap of 200 billion. Albeit it's also now showing bloating before the advent of 2.0. 

I think one of the biggest problem in the crypto space is that people are maxis or die hard for two or three coins.

Their world revolves around the success on those specific ones. However, they don't diversify or rather a lot of people don't know how to and I think that's where the biggest potential is.

I see a lot of promising projects that already work and aren't vapourware with high ceilings and I think more people should be more aware of them because things move fast in this space. You see something like BNB zip by in a few days and it's already taken the third spot.

I guess my point is, be open minded and try new things.

I understand that a lot of people don't have a lot of time to take a deep dive but if you're genuinely interested and you want to succeed in this space, I'd watch videos, read articles or ask peoples opinion on why they're holding something. Don't get too caught up in your own portfolio that you don't see beyond your own bubble.

Just my 2 cents or rather 0.00000036 BTC.",2021-02-24 03:15:38

Deja vu. I've seen in all before.

I see people panicking over the recent price drops of our favourite Crypro currencies, without good reason.

Unless you are a day trader type, you are doing yourself a disservice by worrying about the price.

The truth of the matter is that I, like many others who have been in crypto since 2013, know the secret. And I will share it via PM at the cost of 1000 moons!

Seriously, how many moon whoring posts are the mods gonna allow? Keep your SOB story about how you cashed out your cryptofolio to buy a puppy for the daily discussion, same for your KEEP CALM BUY THE DIP posts when you've been in crypto for like 3 days

I have been hodling since early 2017 and been through the ups and downs.

Since a lot of people are asking if they should sell in the daily discussion I thought it's best to adress the elephant in the room

These swings are normal and necessary. Just expand your graph to 7, 14 days or a month. It dipped from 40 to 30 and went back up to 58. Lots of people said this is the dump and it's going back to 20.

Paypal is in BTC, Tesla and Mastercard started. More and more players will adopt bitcoin. Just imagine if Amazon is gonna dip their feet in there.

However, if you have money in there you can't lose its up to you. But there is no need to panic.

We are literally just continually inundated with a constant echo chamber backing any coin that is currently pumping. If anyone brings up opposition to said coin or points out any flaws with it you end up having someone hit you with “It’s going up though, you’re wrong”. I am beginning to feel like I’m in WSB or the Dogecoin subreddit with the levels of delusion I’m seeing occur in the DD. 

For all my long term crypto guys and gals I feel like I’ve been transported back to 2018 with the level of mania occurring, with obvious green crypto investors offering their “insight” into why anyone who has criticisms is a downright fool. I’m personally ecstatic for the people who have made a killing from this recent BSC boom and hope you all get your money, however we can’t overlook the glaring issue that is it’s centralized nature, just as we can’t overlook Ethereum’s gas fee situation. 

Offering genuine criticism about a project helps others learn about the asset. It can also help you if someone more knowledgeable than yourself rebuts you. In my opinion I think we all need to take a step back and truly evaluate what we are investing in. I know it’s easy to throw money into a bull market and random ALTs and see them rise but please be careful y’all.",2021-02-19 08:37:59

I discovered cryptocurrency in Jan 2018 and I lost 75% of my money. However, this time around, I am up somewhat significantly. I would like to share some pointers I wish I knew back then:




1. There are a few reliable exchanges, like Binance (for global,which I use) and Kraken and Coinbase. Try not to step outside them, even if they don't have some exotic coins that you are hearing about. It's not worth it to sacrifice the security that the reliable ones offer. 









2. DYOR (do your own research) is tough. Many people will tell you to read white papers. But these papers might be misleading, exaggerating, or no longer relevant (with the project changing direction by quite some extent). 






3. Please please PLEASE invest only some money that is your ""play"" money. Even though all money is valuable, the amount should be such that none of your real life plans are negatively affected if this money drops by 50%.







4. Identify a few reliable projects (don't go by alleged partnerships). I'd actually say, go by what mainstream newspapers say about them. I understand it's controversial but this plan is good for new people. Once you're in the field for a year or so, you could start being more risk-taking. Some reliable ones in my opinion are BTC (Bitcoin), ETH (Ethereum), Monero (XMR), XLM (stellar lumens), etc. People say BNB is too. And people say IOTA (my personal favorite) and ADA (Cardano) are futuristic and will be big one day. But I'm not technical enough to really understand it all.






5. Don't chase pumps. If you see something go up over 50% in a day, don't buy it that day. Be patient. It's very very hard, I know. I want to buy some IOTA right now but won't coz it's pumping. 







6. Never believe the loudest voices in the daily discussion when they are yelling about a particular coin (aside from BTC and ETH). They don't know shit and are most likely lying. Or at least hoping. I listened to the crowd and went all in on REQ in 2018. See its price today. 










7. Use Coingecko to check prices and market caps and circulating supply (Google these terms, will help you) 











8. If you buy one of the reliable coins, please don't trade it to chase the flavour of the month. I WISH SOMEONE TOLD ME THIS. I used to have damn cheap (compared with today's prices) BTC and ETH and IOTA (coz I bought this during the bear market, more on that later) but I sold it all to chase trending coins. Lost loads of money. 








9. If you can afford to, put some money on the good coins (see point #4) a year from now, when the market will almost certainly be horrible and all newspapers would have forgotten about crypto. It will benefit you in the long run. 






10. HODL!!!! (till when, I don't know. No one does. Don't trust anyone)",2021-02-19 08:34:56

All I'm seeing is posts complaining about the memes on the weekend. YES I understand, that this post in it self, is now part of that problem.

It's called meme weekends for a reason. Don't like it? Either avoid r/cc on the weekend or propose a better solution. It's why we have a vote system. 

Some members want to get rid of memes, okay we ban memes.  
But then someone will complain about the news links that get spammed, so we ban them.  
Ok then someone will then complain about price movements/ ATH posts, we ban those.
Then there's the shilling? Let's ban that too.  What's left? Just the daily discussion?

Fuck it let's just close the sub, seeing as we can't please everyone.

Remember to stay hydrated, focus on your breathing, maintain your posture, engage in other activities (preferably away from your phone or computer), and, most importantly, ease your focus from staring at charts 24/7. Mental and physical health are way more important in life, especially during the on-going pandemic.

Also, Happy Valentine's Day to r/CryptoCurrency !!

*Side note for newcomers:*

A warm welcome to all of you! There has been a huge influx of questions (especially in the pinned daily discussions and official discord) about what cryptocurrencies to buy. A short answer to this is to DYOR (do your own research). I recommend studying cryptography, blockchain, analytics,  market trends (such as the 2017 bull run), scams like Ponzi and pyramid schemes, and cryptocurrency with real world adoption. In terms of real world adoption, look into: bank usage, partnerships, businesses that accept cryptocurrency, as well as upcoming projects with legitimate potential  that may best older coins and their protocols. One last comment; price predictions should be taken lightly. We are living in some wild times, no one knows for certain what crypto will ""moon"" or dip. Crypto is extremely volatile, don't panic sell! If you're scared an asset is going to drop, set a stop loss to prevent losses if you think a massive dip is inbound.

This is rather brief, and all of this information has been discussed in this subreddit. If you are looking for a quick answer, search the subreddit and you will find several guides for newcomers. FYI this is not meant to discourage asking questions, its more or so about asking questions you cannot find an answer for.

## An Introduction To Cryptocurrency

**What is a Cryptocurrency?**

A cryptocurrency is a new form of currency that is fully digital. It is secured using cryptography, meaning it is extremely difficult to counterfeit or double-spend.

**Where is a Cryptocurrency?**

Most cryptocurrencies are run on a system called blockchain. A blockchain is a large network of computers across the globe keeping a ledger of all transactions and ensuring their integrity. The bigger the blockchain, the more secure it becomes. The network is decentralized, therefore there is no central point to control, attack or manipulate. Interesting fact, Bitcoin is currently the biggest and most secure computer network in the world!

[How does bitcoin actually work? (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4)

**Why do we have Cryptocurrency?**

A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to corporate and government interference or manipulation. Cryptocurrencies aim to revolutionize the financial system by allowing two parties to send money directly instead of through a 'trusted' third party, such as a bank or credit card company. These companies don't exactly have a good track record as they continually break laws and get away with it:

[Global banks defy US crackdowns by serving oligarchs, criminals and terrorists](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/global-banks-defy-u-s-crackdowns-by-serving-oligarchs-criminals-and-terrorists/)

**Bitcoin as a financial asset**

Over the last year Bitcoin has become one of the most popular financial assets to invest in. It has even overtaken gold's popularity in the US. It has outperformed every other asset class for the last 10 years. With such a solid track record it has gained a lot of interest from the traditional world of finance. Institutional and retail investors have been pouring billions of dollars into it as a hedge against the uncertain future of world economies post covid. With central banks printing what seems like an endless supply of new money to prop up their economies, Bitcoin is seen as a safe haven from the inevitable inflation this will create. All of this has caused the price to rise significantly over the last 6 months.

**Cryptocurrencies and the financial system**

Bitcoin has slowly moved away from it's original use as a currency and has become more like a digital gold. Somewhere to store wealth and watch it grow over time, relatively safe from the issues above. This is where the many other crypto's step in. Some are designed to become the new world currencies and payment systems, fast, free and flexible. Others aim to become the new world of finance such as lending money, savings accounts, investing and even new global exchanges far bigger and better than the current stock exchanges. There are even cryptos aiming to revolutionize global logistics, utilities, voting, communications, housing markets and even helping artists to get paid fairly for their work. The list goes on and a lot of the companies behind them are already delivering on their promises and then some. At this level most cryptocurrencies are similar to shares in the company behind them.

**Adoption of Cryptocurrencies**

While the world of crypto may still seem very new to most people, there has been a lot of adoption and maneuvering below the surface. As mentioned above, huge investment companies such as Grayscale, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock and giant hedge funds have been buying a range of cryptos as investments for their very wealthy customers. This shows a lot of trust in the future of crypto. The really big news is that global payment companies such as Visa and PayPal will offer crypto services to potentially billions of people worldwide this year.

**Myths and Misconceptions**

*Bitcoin is mainly used by criminals.* This story is as old as Bitcoin itself. It is true that in the beginning before it matured into what it is today Bitcoin was used widely on the dark web. Today the amount of crypto used for illegal activities is tiny compared to traditional currencies 1000's of times over. To add to this most major banks allow and even facilitate the flow of money to terrorist organizations and global drug cartels and get way with insignificant fines.

*Bitcoin is anonymous.* This feeds into the criminality myth above. Bitcoin is actually a completely transparent system. Every transaction in the history of Bitcoin is publicly available and stored inside the bitcoin network. This immutable transparency is part of Bitcoins strength and security, helping prevent fraud, theft, tampering and corruption.

*Cryptocurrencies do not have any value.* While it is easy to say that cryptocurrencies aren't backed by anything of value, neither are the currencies we use on a daily basis. They are just promises from a government, and how often do they keep their promises? The value of anything is subjective and determined by the free market. This is the way we value the Dollar, Euro, Gold, stocks, crypto and anything else for that matter. If it isn't worth it, people don't pay for it, simple.

*Bitcoin is bad for the environment.* It is true that the process to create and maintain the bitcoin network uses a lot of power. In such a competitive market the Bitcoin network mostly uses the cheapest electricity on the planet. What is the cheapest electricity on the planet? Green energy! The majority of the network is using hydro-electric, geothermic, wind and solar energy. There are even projects using spare energy from power plants that would usually go to waste. This is also pushing green energy development faster to help the rest of us catch up.

[The Green Bitcoin Theory: How are Bitcoin, Electricity Consumption and Green Energy Related?](https://philippsandner.medium.com/the-green-bitcoin-theory-how-are-bitcoin-electricity-consumption-and-green-energy-related-b541b23424ab)

*Cryptocurrencies are a scam.* There is reason to be cautious when it comes to potential scams. The technology behind all the major cryptocurrencies is some of the safest there is. However, savvy investors tend to treat cryptocurrencies in the same way that they would any other investment, with skepticism and a large amount of research. Like any new opportunity to make money that people don't fully understand, there will be opportunist criminals trying to fool you. This is not uncommon in traditional finance either so always do your research and don't be afraid to ask for advice.

**Predictions for the years ahead**

Here is where things get a bit more tricky and in reality, anything can happen! The general consensus across the industry is that over the next one to two years there will be huge growth and a very promising investment potential. This will be down to the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies, widespread adoption and institutional investment. Also the vast array of technologies being developed behind the scenes will mature and start to integrate into all our lives without us even noticing. In the past the cryptocurrency space has gone through cycles of huge price growth, a big dip and a long period of waiting for it to go round again. Each cycle has ended at a much higher value than the last. We are currently at the beginning of the huge price growth section of this cycle and estimates range from the industry growing 5-10 fold this time around.

**TL;DR/Summary**

Cryptocurrencies are a new way of using and interacting with the financial world. They aim to put the power and potential of your money back into your hands in a unique, fair and secure way. The industry as a whole has the potential to change the world and curb so many of the issues that lead to inequality and corruption.Over the years there has been a lot of bad press and misconceptions spread around. The cryptocurrency movement has matured into a vast array of real world solutions and gained support from the same people who tried to talk it down. It is quickly becoming the financial powerhouse of the future with much more revolutionary technology emerging from the shadows. Who knows what the future holds, but I'll be holding crypto!

351,Story of how I got ''rugged'' on Akita (learn the lesson folks),maestro_7,32,lax959,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lax959/story_of_how_i_got_rugged_on_akita_learn_the/,76,"*Disclaimer: No one did actually rug us, price drop organically*

TL;DR: I thrown my precious Moon coin gains to new meme token called Akita Inu and price got down 90% since I bought, or 99% from ATH. And I for some reason stressed alot.

Ok guys, another long story coming from me. I know I cannot change anything, this writting is part of my emotional healing from stress and pain I experianced. It helped me last time similar thing happened to me. So where do I begin. A few nights ago, me and my gf were comfy laying in bed, prepared to go sleeping. I haven't check on r/CryptoCurrency for few days so I decided to enter daily discussion, when I noticed many people asked how to sell Moons. I know I had some, 3,3k to be precise, but last time when I checked it, it was 30$ value so I didn't want to sell back then. I read through the comments that current price is 13c per one, I did the math and I realized I have what is a large sum to me. For reference, I live in Serbia, not very financially rich country, and I'm NEET currently looking for a job. We don't have neetbucks here, and I have like 150$ in savings and like 600$ in crypto. I tried to figure it out how to sell them, but I was unable. I left that for tommorow. Tommorow I did half of the job, and the next day I managed to get wETH on my wallet. It was really pain in the ass to do it, and I was stressed as fuck trying. Meanwhile, crypto was wild, Doge pump, Shiba pump, Donut pump and more. I don't approve memecoins, and I always advised people to stay away from them. Also, I have telegram group where I spend time chatting with crypto friends. Night before my friend Hamster had 400k$ in Shiba but managed to sell for 200k. I felt a stupid, because Shiba did x300 in a week and I advised everyone to be safe and not to risk to much, supposedly I was wrong. 

So, I started an idea with them of us making new coin, there were few devs and many big people, we was brainstorming ideas, names etc. I said: hey, lets make Akita coin, it's similar to Doge and Shiba, people would like it. Friend replies: It already exist, look here. And there I see, brand new token. Literally Shiba copycat, went live 12 hours ago, already dumped much from ATH, not yet listed on Coingecko. I looked like good entry point. I doubted should I do it and I decided to ape. All of my 0.25 wETH went into 9,7 bilion Akitas. People in telegram, Reddit, Twitter, 4chan were all hyped about this. Story was: *hey, you missed on Shiba? Don't miss out on this one buddy.* I'm sure some people throw part of Shiba gains into this. I was thinking, I'm not going to be greedy, I'm only looking for doubling my money and I'm probably out. Yeah I know, it's surely greedy, but other people expected x100 unironically. Also, I'm the asshole who posted Akita thread on /biz/ and probably made more people to lose money unintentionaly. 

**Highlights:** I experianced one of the worst stresses of my life. Had few chances to sell, missed them, hoped for little more pump. Whole fucking day my heart rate was insane. I wasn't feeling well, but selling for a loss is never an option for me. I tried to distrack myself but it would hardly do anything. I decided to go to sleep at 11pm, and just see what happens tomorrow. I slept only for one hour. Been awake few hours then went to sleep again. I mean, at that point I was accepting potential 100% loss in this but I just couldn't help myself. I couldn't control my emotions. I wake up at the middle of the night. I was wet from top to bottom. Hair, shirt, pants, bed, pillow. Everything was in watter. This only happened second or third time in my lifetime. 

I just cannot understand why it's so hard for me to accept gambling away reddit moons. I mean, many people sold them for 10% of a price I sold them, and I could've easily be one of them. In our language we have a saying ''how it come in, that's how it went out''. I would genuinely be more happy if I haven't had moons in first place. Now I think of what could I do with that money. Also, I feel stupid, betrayed, scammed. Worst feeling ever. And no one esle to blame but me. I took a glass of whiskey I found in kitchen, few cigarettes and played sad songs. Now it's getting better.

Thanks for everyone reading this. This was my vent. Stay safe.",2021-02-02 15:52:15

358,Quality of this Sub,ReddSpark,4,l8l727,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l8l727/quality_of_this_sub/,17,"I’ve been a member of this forum for over a year and a half now and I have to say “it was better in my days...”

The majority of the messages are:

1. Moons
2. Doge
3. People clearly trying to collect upvotes 

I realize it’s not an easy thing for Mods to manage. They’ve tried experiment with different moon incentive mechanisms and you don’t want to curtail free speech. But I’m writing this as I found myself joining another sub instead and thinking to myself I don’t care that this other sub won’t reward me with moons, I’d rather give that up to have a good place for e discussion.

What can be done? 

Well my suggestions would be:

1. Have a megathread for anyone wanting to talk about Doge (regardless of whether it to shill it or criticize it)

2. Get rid of Moons. Yes - controversial I know. I’m literally saying a crypto community should get rid of a crypto, and one that was earning some of them money.  But let’s take a look hard look and admit - it’s ruined discussion. Yes , it really has. 

3. As I know #2 will never happen let me try this, Have a separate “Moon Free Daily Discussion” thread where participants know that they won’t be gaining any moons. Imagine that - what better way to be know you’ll be reading quality posts than by going to a thread where you know nobody is being incentivized to farm upvotes.",2021-01-30 13:59:56

I'm seeing more and more threads portraying specific crypto's potential with unwarranted certainty. I'm also seeing more and more comments from newcomers who still haven't had the life lesson of 'timing the market is far, far harder than it sounds' drilled into them yet.

Most cryptos still have 0 adoption beyond maybe some proof-of-concept tests by big name companies. I see far too much language where people are generalising these early tests as 'entire industry/country embraces altcoin #2637'

None of your holdings are safe long term, some of the current biggest names will have collapsed within the next 5 years and you won't know which until it happens. This should not be your retirement plan (if you hit the moonshot and can retire then great, but fund it with disposable income not your long term savings).

I just think for the sanity of this sub this coming year, we need to bring the skeptic's thread back into the spotlight. (Maybe replace the moon's distribution sticky?)

Maybe even somehow utilise moons to encourage thoughtful discussion within it rather than just bickering. I think it would be a good goal for it to be at least somewhat active on a weekly basis, not barren on a monthly basis as it is currently.",2021-01-25 17:08:39

Edit: 0 upvotes, I know its a red day but lets have some positivity  around here I guess we wont break the record :(

Vote for the coin of the day in the Poll below, ill gather the most ""hyped"" coins from the Daily Discussion of the day and will list them in the Poll.

the Winner coin will be pronounced **Coin Of The Day of January 11**  🥇.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Last time we voted was in January 7th and we had 19.2K votes! lets see the results!**

the voting started with a big leap forward of Nano and XLM but Bitcoin came in rushing hot after almost getting the 40K mark.

# The Winner of Coin of the day January 7 is: 🥇Bitcoin🥇

&#x200B;

I have made some changes based on the feedback I have received last time and would love your opinion on it:

* I will list only Alt-coins, we all love BTC but lets give some spotlight to others as well.
* Coin of the day will be hosted two times a week, Monday and Friday.
* I'm thinking about making a second Poll list next time with all the popular coins on [https://www.strawpoll.me/](https://www.strawpoll.me/) what do you think about it?

other Popular coins that didn't make it to the poll this time are:

LTO, Doge, Vet, Link :(

Let's see if we can beat the Voting record!

&#x200B;

if there's a coin that you like and isn't listed in the poll feel free to put him in the comment section, the maximum amount of options per poll is 6.

If you have any Suggestions feel free to list them down below!

It's exciting we're in a bull run. You can wake up to see your moonshot moon, earn your salary overnight, but we got some people literally pouring life savings in this market like it's nothing. In the end of the day, like stocks, it's just speculative risk. Crypto is one of the most volatile markets you can be in. The 2017-2018 crash literally got suicide hotlines pinned to the r/cc daily discussion. It's easy for you to get anxiety over your portfolio.

I get ever since after early 2018 you're scared as hell to see your portfolio drop to rock bottom. Please invest only what you can afford to lose. And set your damn stop limit orders. It's a powerful tool. Or think long term. Diamond hand HODLing will almost guarantee you nice profits in 5-10 years. Patience pays off.

One thing I learned about correction is it gives you a hard kick to stop sitting in front of a screen watching profits and do something for your physical and mental health.

Get some exercise, fresh air, talk to friends and family. Limit your chart checking. Live life.",2021-01-11 07:07:59

390,Jan 7 - Vote for the Coin of the Day! who's gonna win today?,DivineEu,2592,ksetg6,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ksetg6/jan_7_vote_for_the_coin_of_the_day_whos_gonna_win/,485,"Let's try to make a new tradition for this Sub!  🎉

Vote for the coin of the day in the Poll below, ill gather the most ""hyped"" coins from the Daily Discussion of the day and will list them in the Poll.

the Winner coin will be pronounced **Coin Of The Day of Jan 7**  🥇.

if there's a coin that you like and isn't listed in the poll feel free to put him in the comment section, the maximum amount of options per poll is 6.

If you have any Suggestions feel free to list them down below!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Edit: wow the poll blew up really well 17.2K voting, i didn't see that coming !**

It was pretty fun watching the poll votes go sideways till BTC won and got to 40K!🎉

I think it can be really fun to vote on polls like this every once in a while but putting up One Pull each day doesn't seem like a good idea because we will get burnt-out by the polls pretty quickly.

* I'm thinking about making a new Poll every Sunday and Thursday, so the polls will be bi-weekly.
* One other suggestion that i have heard is to remove Bitcoin and maybe ETH from the Poll and make it a full ALT list, what do you think about it?

(Do let me know if you prefer other days or other format like 1-7 polls per week)

Would love to hear your opinion on that, thanks for reading!😁

##Beginner Tips:

  - **Don't put in more money than you are comfortable losing.** There have been many large drops in bitcoins history and some even larger ones for alts. Cryptocurrencies are still very volatile. If a big drop in prices will cause you financial stress you should reconsider your position. It is hard not to get caught up in the FOMO and put in more then you are comfortable with. 
  
  - Most, if not all reputable exchanges require KYC, which is the process of verifying your account. This is a common practice, but make sure you are signing up to a reputable exchange. You need to trust these people with your personal data and identity. There is most likely a waiting period to get verified on exchanges so be patient. Stick to the larger more reputable exchanges such as Kraken, Coinbase, Gemini or whatever exchange is reputable in your local area. Don't make hasty decisions when it comes to choosing an exchange. Watch out for scam exchanges that offer lower than spot rates and have no KYC you may see advertised on social media.
  
  - **Do not base your decisions off price alone.** Some peoples first instinct is to buy coins that are under a dollar thinking they will someday be valued at the same price in dollars as bitcoin. Marketcap is a much better metric to determine if a coin is over-priced or not. Market cap is the price of the coin times the number of coins in circulation. Some coins are cheap because they have literally billions of coins in circulation but still have a massive marketcap. XRP is a good example of this. Make sure you look at the ""tokenomics"" of a coin or how it is distributed. Try not to get caught up in the FOMO and do a bit of research before diving into a coin.
  
  - **Be very weary of trading groups.** These groups mostly exist to dump on the people they give the signals to. They load up on a low-cap alt with low liquidity, signal a pump to the followers, then dump on them as they buy in. Only the people at the top are making money.
  
  - **Scammers.** Everywhere in this space is scammers waiting for you to make a mistake and steal or trick you into sending them your coins. Consider everything a scam until you can prove otherwise. Do not make any hasty decisions. The term ""if its too good to be true it most likely is"" really holds true in this space. Watch out for fake support staff trying to trick you into revealing your private keys or mnemonics and You-tube videos offering to double your bitcoin. There is no such thing as free money (unless you got the uni or 1INCH airdrop 🦄). Be especially careful on social media sites like twitter, facebook and discord.
  
  - **Watch out for** [**phishing websites**](https://i.imgur.com/g1Uv51J.png) when doing google searches. Scammers will often use special characters to make the domain look similar to the real domain. If the site is one you visit often save a bookmark to that site instead of using google search.
  
  - Mining these days is mostly a waste of time unless you have the newest equipment and very cheap source of electricity. Watch out for cloud mining schemes as these will become very unprofitable as the mining difficulty rises. These are targeted at newcomers who do not know how mining works and the contract will run way longer then it's profitable.

  - Make sure you are aware of your countries specific laws regarding capital gains. Keep track of all your buys and sells so you can come up with a cost-basis. If you are a high-frequency trader consider using a software program like coinly or cointracker to keep track of all your trades.
  
  - **Consider picking up a hardware wallet** if you have a good amount of coins. These are highly recommended by users of this sub and for good reason. Hardware Wallets will offer a much higher level of protection than software wallets and are very user friendly. Trezor and Ledger are the two most popular models. Keep your 24 words safe in a secure offline location. If you forego getting a HW wallet, make sure the device you use is free of malware and viruses. Do not save backups of private keys in plaintext on your computer.
  
  - **Use good two-factor authentication** wherever possible. SMS 2FA is not good enough. You can search all the [horror stories](https://np.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/gdcgd9/coinbase_account_hacked/) of people who have had their exchange accounts hacked because they only had SMS 2FA and got sim-swapped. TOTP 2FA such as Google Authenticator or AUTHY are much better solutions or if you want to go even more secure get a hardware key like yubikey. Do not re-use common passwords, consider using a password manager like 1password or lastpass as these will also help mitigate phishing attacks because they will only input your password if you are at the correct domain.

Risin' up, back on the dip  
Sell the top, took my chances  
Went all in, now I'm back on my feet  
Just a man and his will to hodl

So it is time, it happens too fast  
You sell your crypto for LAMBO  
Don't lose your keys in a boat accident  
You must make sure to keep them all safe

It's the eye of the trader, it's the thrill of the dip  
Risin' up to the dump of our rival  
And the last known hodler stalks his prey in the night  
And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the trader

Peer to peer, and the blockchain  
Hangin' tough, stayin' safe  
They stack the odds 'til we take to the Moon  
For the coin with the skill to moon

It's the eye of the trader, it's the thrill of the dip  
Risin' up to the dump of our rival  
And the last known hodler stalks his prey in the night  
And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the trader

Risin' up, straight to the Moon  
Had the guts, got the LAMBO  
Went all in, now I'm not gonna stop  
Just a man and his will to hodl

It's the eye of the trader, it's the thrill of the dip  
Risin' up to the dump of our rival  
And the last known hodler stalks his prey in the night  
And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the trader

440,Proposal to remove moons gained/lost from the daily,SenatusSPQR,86,k1cjd3,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/k1cjd3/proposal_to_remove_moons_gainedlost_from_the_daily/,63,"Since Moons have been implemented, we've seen ""upvote rings"" at work in the daily discussion, while at other times seeing mass downvotes. We're also seeing a lot of posts that don't add to the discussion, but are fishing for upvotes such as ""POPULAR COIN TAKE MY ENERGY"", ""Upvote crew, time to get to work"" and such. This happens far less in posts outside the daily, which makes sense as moderation is also less stringent on the daily than on the rest of the subreddit. Realistically, we also have a chatroom for this, but the Daily Discussion seems to have become our de facto chat room.

&#x200B;

The actual valuable posts and discussions happen outside the daily, while the daily is used mostly to spam. In my opinion this is okay and gives everyone a nice outlet for these sort of comments, but I think that we should reward moons to the valuable posts and discussions rather than to spamming. This is why I propose to not award Moons for karma gained in the daily posts. The net effect of this would be more Moons going to people creating posts and comments outside the daily, while we can keep the daily for chat and spam, and not care about the upvotes/downvotes there.

It's important to remember that bullish and bearish market sentiment can change in a heartbeat. As today, crypto markets (particularly Bitcoin) are looking a lot more optimistic, I thought it would be interesting to look back on some of the highlights from the Daily Discussion back when the markets crashed hard during March of this year. Some comments have aged better than others. If I have selected one of your comments and it hasn't aged well, don't take it personally! I have made plenty of such comments myself down the years (Eth to 10k by eoy 2018 and more recently, Nano to $50 in 2021). We all have. Sharing our sometimes wise, sometimes misguided, often emotional opinions is part of what makes this sub so great. So, all in the name of good fun and reminiscence:

A constantly updated stickied thread just below the daily discussion with links to good posts and comments that got less than a certain threshold of upvotes, with a brief explanation for each one. Something like this….  

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Under the Radar Content on r/CryptoCurrency

**Controversial Post.** User [u/ethereumflow](https://www.reddit.com/user/ethereumflow/) writes [a detailed post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jsbcxz/i_am_100_in_alts_and_i_have_doubled_my_crypto/) about the 100% gain in his all altcoins portfolio and advocates a research based approach, many users attack him because his gains came during a bull run, other users defend him. Grab your shield or your pitchfork and get involved! Remember, even if you disagree, tell him why in the comments; don't downvote a high effort post that generated a lot of good discussion.

**New Perspective:** User [u/cecil\_X](https://www.reddit.com/user/cecil_X/) asks, what [if Satoshi is actually an evil genius](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jod23y/bitcoin_and_the_elephant_in_the_room/)?

**Good Samaritan.** u/(I couldn't find this post again) offers to give $1 of xdai to anyone who ""needs"" it. Big hearted hero or easy prey for every choosing beggar and scammer? Either way, he's going to need a few moons from you.

**Helpful Link:** With no fanfare, u/shst  [introduces a tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jrx2m7/daily_discussion_november_11_2020_gmt0/gbzj7lq/?context=3) to easily and accurately measure impermanent loss in your liquidity pools.

**Make the World a Better Place:** User [u/crypto\_grandma](https://www.reddit.com/user/crypto_grandma/) advocates [a simple strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jsv3xo/fighting_back_against_the_downvoters_your_sub/) to counter mindless downvoting. Will it work? Have your say in the post. 

**Great Joke Nobody Heard:** User u/flapjackmongoose gets crickets in response to what was, to be fair, [a pretty good joke](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jqz6o4/moon_farming_proposal_on_honeyswap/gbrs58r/?context=3) about being a lurker on this sub.

**Other potential Categories**

Underappreciated OC Meme: (that got less than 25 upvotes)

Very Helpful Post: (that got less than 50 upvotes)

Helpful Comment: (that got less than 5 votes)

High Effort Post: (that got less than 50 votes)

Article that Provoked Discussion: (that got less than 50 votes)

&#x200B;

**Who would do the work?**

I suggest people volunteer and the mods choose someone to do it, maybe for one month at a time. The person chosen should be a long-time sub member with a positive post history. They would get a lot of upvotes (and so moons) for their hard work since the post itself and every comment they make alerting people to good content might well get upvoted. Of course you couldn't recommend your own content (like I did above)

&#x200B;

**Good Content Gets Noticed and then Upvoted**

People who click on the links to see the content are likely to upvote and comment on it. This means content that otherwise would be lost gets a second chance.

So, what do you think? Would it work? Would you use a thread like this to help you find and support quality content?

Note: these are some posts that I interacted with and enjoyed and stuck in my head, and all of them got low votes (except u/cryptograndma 's thread which escaped its earlier downvote brigading) despite generating a lot of conversation.",2020-11-12 20:27:54

481,Some thoughts on MOONs,CryptoBanano,10,jcukkv,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jcukkv/some_thoughts_on_moons/,31,"So, Reddit has found a new way to monetize the internet. And the more i think about it, the more i see it as a genius move.

We know that social media make money on ads (and probably personal data leaks but let's not get into that). So, they are incentivizing people that contribute positively to the community with money, which makes the space more interesting, brings more engagement, and therefore more revenue for Reddit.

Also, the more quality content the more interesting the place becomes, but the good thing is it's not just about quality content, if the post is a funny meme or just something interesting it also gets upvotes, so everything that people see as positive gets rewarded, which is exactly what makes someone keep coming back or joining a community. 

I remember the daily discussion here had about 200-300 comments on average most times before Moons were implemented, now we are getting 2k comments on weekdays (!) so we can see that it is actually working.

When someone contributes a website with a review, they are somehow contributing for the data of that particular website to be more reliable (the more reviews and better quality of them will surely bring more users) and also increases their revenue. Imagine they start paying users for quality reviews.

Point is, we might have started a experiment that could become the new internet standard. What they are doing here can be also applied on basically any website that increases the number of visitors with community contribution, which are the absolute majority nowadays. 

And the best thing about it is that Reddit themselves spent very little on this (basically the cost of creating a crypto) and all of this could happen thanks to cryptocurrencies!

So thank you Reddit for implementing Moons, I really think it's a win win for everybody!


tldr: Reddit might be setting a new internet standard by financially rewarding people that contribute with something seeing as positive to the community and brings more users and visitors, therefore bringing more revenue",2020-10-17 14:51:01

485,PROPOSAL — Downvotes don’t count negatively for moon distribution,B_knight142,26,japwhh,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/japwhh/proposal_downvotes_dont_count_negatively_for_moon/,96,"In many posts, including the daily discussion, I see full threads downvoted for absolutely no reason. People do this for the sole reason of making their comment/post viewed more, because reddit shows downvoted comments at the end of the list of comments. One choice would be for reddit to change how upvotes/karma and things like that work, but they probably wouldn’t want to do that before coins are rolled out across all of reddit. So, I think we should at least change it so that these downvotes don’t count negatively for moon distribution. Rather, moons should be solely based on upvotes, negating all downvotes.

People can’t even comment their opinions, scared that they’ll lose moons for no good reason.

629,Daily Discussion: TrueUSD TUSD,joenorwood77,8,g3tle5,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/g3tle5/daily_discussion_trueusd_tusd/,4,"-Today's Crypto of the Day is TrueUSD TUSD, and it's current price is $0.9999.


DUE TO SOME PERSONAL ISSUES, I AM TEMPORARILY BEHIND ON FOLLOW UP POSTS. I WILL EVENTUALLY CATCH UP AND POST MY OPINIONS ON ALL OF THEM. I AM NOT TRYING TO MAKE LOW EFFORT POSTS AND WILL DO MY BEST TO POST A NEW DISCUSSION DAILY FOR A WHILE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING. 


-Since 2/18/20, I have posted a crypto/asset of the day for discussion.  I typically begin by posting the current price, as well as the brief CoinMarketCap summary. If there is a video featuring it on Coin Bureau, I also post that. After a week or so, I usually post replies to some of the posts, and I also add an overall summary of my thoughts, if I plan to hold any, and is so how much. 

-I strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. There is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. You may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. I know I certainly did!
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=author%3Ajoenorwood77&restrict_sr=on

-My first month or so I featured projects listed on some of the main exchanges. Now I plan to focus on the top 100 on CoinMarketCap. After that I expect to broaden to the top 200, and then some random moonshots. I will eventually create a post looking for any projects I should feature before I eventually close this project.

-Just because I feature a project does not mean I like it. I feel discussion on bad projects are just as important as the good ones. It is useful to hear pros and cons about every project, even if you are simply playing devils advocate.

-I would say a perfect reply would include at least one pro and at least one con for the project. However, I still feel it is acceptable if you post only pros or cons. If your post does not have any substance to it, ""this coin is a scam"", ""avoid this shitcoin"", ""this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020"", then I will just assume you are posting for personal gain rather than helping the community.  If you simply downvote the post without any comments, the only thing you accomplish is having less people view the post. I do not care about Reddit Karma, but if a post drops to zero early on, it can be extremely difficult for people to even find these discussions (which I assume is your intention). 

-These posts are not meant to be financial advice, but instead to be an educational discussion. Everyone is responsible for doing their own research. For each project, I am interested in learning if you have any investment in it, and if so, about what percentage of your portfolio does it carry. Most importantly, what should we all know; good, bad, and indifferent, about this project? ",2020-04-18 21:39:43

-Since 2/18/20, I have posted a crypto/asset of the day for discussion.  I typically begin by posting the current price, as well as the brief CoinMarketCap summary. If there is a video featuring it on Coin Bureau, I also post that. After a week or so, I usually post replies to some of the posts, and I also add an overall summary of my thoughts, if I plan to hold any, and is so how much. 

-I strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. There is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. You may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. I know I certainly did!
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=author%3Ajoenorwood77&restrict_sr=on

-My first month or so I featured projects listed on some of the main exchanges. Now I plan to focus on the top 100 on CoinMarketCap. After that I expect to broaden to the top 200, and then some random moonshots. I will eventually create a post looking for any projects I should feature before I eventually close this project.

-Just because I feature a project does not mean I like it. I feel discussion on bad projects are just as important as the good ones. It is useful to hear pros and cons about every project, even if you are simply playing devils advocate.

-I would say a perfect reply would include at least one pro and at least one con for the project. However, I still feel it is acceptable if you post only pros or cons. If your post does not have any substance to it, ""this coin is a scam"", ""avoid this shitcoin"", ""this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020"", then I will just assume you are posting for personal gain rather than helping the community.  If you simply downvote the post without any comments, the only thing you accomplish is having less people view the post. I do not care about Reddit Karma, but if a post drops to zero early on, it can be extremely difficult for people to even find these discussions (which I assume is your intention). 

-These posts are not meant to be financial advice, but instead to be an educational discussion. Everyone is responsible for doing their own research. For each project, I am interested in learning if you have any investment in it, and if so, about what percentage of your portfolio does it carry. Most importantly, what should we all know; good, bad, and indifferent, about this project? ",2020-04-12 02:04:50

We may be at a fakeout and test lower resistance. It doesn't matter. New people come here because this sub is /r/cryptocurrency, which is likely the second place anyone new to this market will look. Likely the first being bitcoin sub.

This place can be extremely toxic, especially if someone sees some rando coin pump and ask about it. 

We need to remember that before we knew anything, we knew nothing. I dont care if you joined in 2012 or 2020, you likely came here to learn.

It is in all our best interest to treat people with respect. To answer their questions. To help them. To make them feel welcome. Because if the first impression someone has of this ""exciting new world changing technology"" is a sub full of autists, then they will nope the fuck out of here and cement the position in their mind that crypto is for losers in basements and the world shouldn't take this technology seriously.

So, if you are here to make money, fine. If you are here to chill and shoot the shit with people in the daily discussion, fine. But remember that we are the face and first impression of this technology, and if we want adoption, then we need to be respectful human beans.

To me, it's more serious than just mooning. I believe the human race needs a financial system overhaul, or we are just fucking done for. Every broken thing on the planet, every existential threat from insect collapse to plastic waste to climate change all is exasperated by a financial system of constant growth that is fundamentally at odds with living on a finite planet.

687,Discussion on Exchanges,joenorwood77,2,f209ca,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/f209ca/discussion_on_exchanges/,6,"First off, I am a newbie, so please bear with me. :-)

I have made previous posts trying to gather information on some of the most trusted, respected and affordable exchanges available to those here in the U.S. I have learned a lot and still learning.

I understand some people feel that fees are all ""close enough"" and I should not be spending time on this research, and instead should be applying this time and effort into research of different cryptocurrency. 

Anyways, I hope the information I have gathered is helpful. If I post anything that is inaccurate, please let me know.

Basically, I am trying to identify the best exchanges to use. It seems many agree that here in the U.S., the best to use in no particular order are probably Binance US, Coinbase/Coinbase Pro, Gemini, and Kraken. I have read mixed things on KuCoin, but seems worth mentioning.

I was trying to compare apples to apples, so I will repost some information I used in a previous daily discussion. For each one, I am using numbers as if I am depositing $10,001 USD, buying, selling, and eventually withdrawing $10,001 back to my bank account.

Coinbase is free for USD deposit, buying fee is $146.83, I am assuming the same fee for selling?, and then free to withdraw? So $293,66 total from start to finish. I should note many seem to prefer this because they are familiar with it and very intuitive and user friendly for newbies. It amazes me how much of a following Coinbase still has with those crazy fees. I know we are paying for convenience as they are quick to let you deposit a large amount of USD, and the website and app are clean and easy to use. 

Coinbase Pro, buying is free, taker/maker fee from $10k to 50k is 0.35% so $35 to buy and $35 to sell, and free to withdraw, so $70 total from start to finish. Popular because it is easy to just use funds from Coinbase if already there, and of course Pro is cheaper on fees.

Gemini, buying is free, taker/maker fee is 1% so $100.01 to buy and $100.01 to sell, and free to withdraw, so $200.02 total from start to finish. People who use Gemini seem to prefer the clean, simple and easy to use website/app. Restricting to only $500 daily ACH deposit is disappointing for sure. I love the app, but with the extreme limits in ACH deposit, crypto available, and fees beat by a few others, I may have to let this one go. 

Kraken, buying is $5, taker/maker fee is 0.16% / 0.26% so $16.01 or $26.01 to buy and the same to sell, and $5 to withdraw, so $42.02 to $62.02 total from start to finish. I think Kraken is super underrated from what I have seen so far. Far lower fees than most, and a nice variety of altcoins. 

Binance US is free for deposit,  0.1% for buy and sell is each only $10.01, and if use BNB then only 0.075% each for buy and sell at only $7.51 each. Withdrawing is also free. So total $15.02 or $20.02. By far the most affordable of the options I listed, if all of my research and math is true. I do know some are not a fan of the website/app as too bloated. 

Why do people use Coinbase as an on/off ramp if Binance US is already free for deposit and withdrawal???

It seems all a person needs is Binance and maybe 1-2 other exchanges that have more longshot altcoins?

Someone did mention they use all above mentioned exchanges because fees are only one factor. They are more concerned with the ease of liquefying crypto when needed, so I assume that means needing enough buyers on an exchange when you want to sell a bunch of something. And this also probably goes for needing a lot of crypto for sale when you want to buy.  

Overall though, with how outstanding Binance US is with low fees, as well as a decent selection of crypto, and being able to deposit USD, shouldn't this one single exchange be enough for most people, and then maybe add KuCoin and/or Kraken for someone who wants access to some longshot altcoins? 

Anyways, which exchanges do you each use (and when for each)?

Am I missing any that should be seriously considered?

**Rules:**

* All [sub rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules/) apply here.
* Discussion topics **must** be on topic, i.e. only related to skeptical or critical discussion about cryptocurrency. Markets or financial advice discussion, will most likely be removed and is better suited for the daily thread. 
* Promotional top-level comments will be removed. For example, giving the current composition of your portfolio or stating you sold X coin for Y coin(shilling), will promptly be removed. 
* Karma and age requirements are in full effect and may be increased if necessary.

***

**Guidelines:** 

* Share any uncertainties, shortcomings, concerns, etc you have about crypto related projects.
* Refer topics such as price, gossip, events, etc to the [Daily Discussion](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=title%3A%22Daily+Discussion%22+&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).
* Please report top-level promotional comments and/or shilling.

**Resources and Tools:**

* Read through the [CryptoWikis Library](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/library) for material to discuss and consider contributing to it if you're interested. r/CryptoWikis is the home subreddit for the CryptoWikis project. Its goal is to give an equal voice to supporting and opposing opinions on all crypto related projects.
* Consider changing your comment sorting around to find more critical discussion. Sorting by controversial might be a good choice.
* Share links to any high-quality critical content posted in the past week. To help with this, try reading through the [*Critical Discussion* search listing](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=flair%3ACritical-Discussion&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).

863,How do we keep BTC decentralized (the 51% attack),ownblocks,24,cbgipr,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/cbgipr/how_do_we_keep_btc_decentralized_the_51_attack/,104,"Remember when back in 2014 [Ghash.io](http://ghash.io) gained so much control over Bitcoin they almost drowned the whole coin?

51% attack is a big concern of the crypto community. Basically, any pool large enough can control the blockchain.

[""They could prevent transactions of their choosing from gaining any confirmations, thus making them invalid, potentially preventing people from sending Bitcoins between addresses. They could also reverse transactions they send during the time they are in control (allowing double spend transactions), and they could potentially prevent other miners from finding any blocks for a short period of time.""](http://learncryptography.com/51-attack/)

This is very dangerous considering that [hashrates are getting higher](https://www.crypto51.app/) but we don't even know where it all comes from.

as /u/biba8163 mentioned in the daily discussion thread, [BTC.com](http://btc.com) and Antpool (who're owned by Bitmain) now [own 30% and are increasing by the day](https://www.blockchain.com/en/pools).

Bitmain did approach 51% too last year so it all still seems pretty sketchy

What do we do about this? Join independent pools? What other solutions are there? I believe this is going to be a recurring problem if we don't deal with it right now",2019-07-10 15:10:20

1071,Nano shills: Stop spamming this sub. No one wants your shitcoin,NikhilRao1334,0,ak9jzn,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ak9jzn/nano_shills_stop_spamming_this_sub_no_one_wants/,25,"It seems a new wave of Nano shills are taking over the daily discussion threads. 

Nano will fail because it has no marketing.  A coin that launched last week, Grin, has better marketing than Nano with legit people talking about it already than Nano has ever had. 

Nano is almost exclusively a reddit shill coin. 4chan was on it too, because they dumped and now redditors are the sole bag holders from $40 to now. 

I have not heard a single person who has a decent reputation talk about Nano - like Andreas Antonopulous, Vitalik, Charles Hoskinson etc... Charlee Lee done a pump and dump on Nano, thats about it. 

Shilling it repeatedly over here will only ensure you get a even worse reputation for your coin. Nano already has a terrible reputation after Bitgrail. 

Just stick to your own subs. Come back here when someone who isnt an anonymous reddit account is taking about it (which is probably never) 

With its current state, Nano will go nowhere. It already has a huge number of bagholders waiting to break even. Shilling it to newcomers isnt going to work ",2019-01-27 07:08:40

So,  I have a crazy idea.  Let's convince Elon Musk to add a BTC wallet to each car.  It would  be an amazing step in the adoption phase,  more people would actually USE cryptocurrencies at all.  It would be splendid for paying tolls,  gas,  drive-ins...  

So,  can we in all r/cc unite and get one thing done? 

Cheers to the new moons! Happy Holidays and 2019.

1352,PLEASE READ: What beginners need to know about the crypto market + 4 types of people in crypto,drinkyafkingmilk,24,95ii18,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/95ii18/please_read_what_beginners_need_to_know_about_the/,17,"I've been observing the reactions to this market and how rocky it has been. Please read this, especially if you're fairly new to the game. 

I’ve come to realize that there are 4 kinds of people in crypto;

A. The “quick money scheme” person

B. The believer in the technology associated with Blockchain and it’s revolutionary effect on our system of exchanging data and wealth

C. The “noob” who is new to this space and legitimately wants to learn 

D. The Hater... or Mr FUD as I say (Relentlessly bashing on excellent projects by calling them shitcoins in the daily discussion threads or other things of that nature)

For the quick money schemer, (A), they are divided into two categories :

1. The “I want to invest $100 and have a Lambo in 6 months” (unrealistic) person

2. The “send me .2BTC and I’ll send you 2BTC in 48hrs” person, better known as a scammer that preys on the newcomer and ill-informed 

For the believer, (B) one thing rings true:

I am in this in order to be a part of something bigger than myself. Is there money to be made? Sure. But when they technology supersedes the fiat market we use to get involved in this, FIAT will no longer be an issue or a topic of discussion. We are building the future.

For the “noob” (newcomer/C):

1. Welcome
2. We have all been in your shoes at some point
3. Be careful and question everthing
4. Be safe online when dealing exchanges, wallets, etc....this is your money at stake. Take all necessary precautions. I cannot stress this enough. 
5. If you don’t know the answer to something, ask. And once you have that answer, ask someone else and verify.

- firewalls
- antivirus
- anti malware 
- 2fa
- strong passwords
- written seeds/logins/passwords
- VPN
- secure connections to sites
- make sure you use legitimate links
- etc... etc...

Now that only leaves The Hater (D) ... Mr FUD

1. We have enough FUD being spread online by the media, governments, and banks...we don’t need more from this community.
2. FUD spreads like wildfire...it’s dangerous
3. If you believe in what this market and system means, you wouldn’t be saying certain things
4. If you don’t like what you are seeing, then maybe you aren’t ready to continue this journey (investing, learning, etc) 
5. Don’t ruin it for newcomers
6. Everyone has made mistakes
7. *** Crypto is still in its infancy
8. *** If you were around to see BTC fall from $19,600 to $10,500 in a matter of days, then $7400 to $6500 is a cake-walk 
9. Many people are in the “red”... but if you are still seeing your portfolio in terms of FIAT amount, then you aren’t seeing the bigger picture and are not immersed in the technology side of it as much as you claim 
10. If you don’t want to continue on this journey, then simply don't.

Everyone is going through different points on this roller coaster. Some of us have been in crypto for a long time...we have seen worse, and we know that we will be just fine. We adapt, buy the dip if we can, and wait. We take the time to learn TA, to ask good questions and prepare for the next roller coaster ride.

For newcomers, I’m very jealous. Learn as much as you can before even investing a single penny. Don’t jump the gun and don’t take simply one person’s advice or opinion as gold, including mine if you ask me for anything. Everyone has different experiences, different levels of knowledge about the market and TA...and we have all made mistakes.

I didn’t mean for this to be a rant, I just thought I’d voice my point of view on what I’ve seen the last 13 hours and what I expect to see until we have our next bull run.

Good luck and be safe. Peace.",2018-08-08 05:27:04

1484,"Becoming part of the adoption, suggestions anyone?",acrowley13,7,8k4bmf,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8k4bmf/becoming_part_of_the_adoption_suggestions_anyone/,10,"I ask you, r/Cryptocurrency, how many of you have bought something with crypto? 


I got into crypto to make money. To be honest, I had no idea what blockchain was and I didn't really care - I have a high risk appetite and was just excited to be able to invest in something so volatile. I was part of that wave of ""stupid money"" that came in last year.


Naturally, I expanded from BTC to LTC and ETH on Coinbase, and then finally into the world of Binance and this thread. I began trawling through posts, articles, and the daily discussion thread in search of new gems. I think there were, and still are, a lot of people like me on here. Probably the majority of us in fact. 


As I soullessly searched for and investigated coins with high ROI potential I learned things. I learned about the underlying technologies, about the various communities, and about the problems facing the space itself: scalability, bad actors, ADOPTION.


""Oh, if only there was more adoption."" I thought. ""My coins would fly me to the moon. To Venus. To distant galaxies!""


I never actually tried buying anything with crypto myself. Or looking to see what dApps are out there that I could be using. The only reason I even got an ERC20 wallet was to buy coins on IDEX. 


But that doesn't make sense. There's value in participating in the space, EVEN IF YOU'RE JUST HERE TO TRADE.


We have this massive community of people speculating and trading value back and forth but, for the most part, not doing anything to increase that value. We talk about adoption like it's something that only other people can make happen. Let's change that! 


I've downloaded Brave and am using it as my default browser. I've set up wallets and am looking for vendors that accept NANO and ETH. To be honest, I don't know where to go after that. Obviously a lot of crypto projects are still under development and not yet available to the public in any useful form. 


What do you guys use? What are some good ways to participate? Which projects have useful, functional products out already? Which projects will soon? We could even get a guide going!",2018-05-17 15:39:53

Deleting all crypto related apps seems like the best option. But it’s almost hard because what if you miss major FUD on your long term hodl, or the market rebounds and you want to take profits. 

Today I found myself taking a shit at work looking through the daily discussion to realize I was gone for 12 minutes and have yet to drop an ounce of poo.

1536,Three new rule changes on /r/Cryptocurrency,AdamSC1,738,85ow78,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/85ow78/three_new_rule_changes_on_rcryptocurrency/,249,"Today we are announcing three major rule changes that will be rolling out here on /r/Cryptocurrency.

Over the past few months, as cryptocurrency boomed and attracted new attention, this sub swelled with hundreds of thousands of new users. While this was a rather exciting event, it also came with some challenges, and we realized:

1. This sub is frequently under attack from professional manipulation groups who use FUD, bots, and other manipulation attacks to mislead the market.

2. Our current rules have a number of gaps that lead to clutter, and types of posts that are easily manipulated.

After receiving confirmation from the Reddit Admins, of numerous professional and highly-orchestrated manipulation groups being identified, as well as having the Reddit Admins site-ban more than 800+ manipulator accounts in a single day, we set about to make a series of rule changes that we believe will combat these challenges.

The following rule changes will be “soft-enforced” starting as of today. The “soft-enforcement” will mean that any post violating these rules will be removed and users will be warned about the infraction, but users will not be banned while we rollout the new rules unless there are intentional repeated infractions.

The soft-enforcement will last until April 2nd, at which time these rules will be enforced like any other rule set.

**Rule Change #1 – A new sub for Cryptomemes**

Media and comedy posts are great, but we repeatedly face two challenges:

1. Users abuse the grey line between what is/what is not a comedy post in order to shill or spread FUD.
2. Comedy posts and memes flood the front page, and prevent valuable news and discussion from thriving in this community.

For this reason, we’ll be removing comedy posts and memes from /r/Cryptocurrency and redirecting them to our new sister-sub /r/Cryptocurrencymemes

This way users can choose between a more serious sub, or enjoying a crypto-themed memefest.

**Rule Change #2 – Refining the Definition of “Low Quality/Off-Topic Posts” to reduce spam and shilling.**

/r/Cryptocurrency was designed for important and relevant news about multiple cryptocurrencies, as well as news and detailed discussion about the cryptocurrency community as a whole.

While there are often times that posts about a single-coin are merited here, there are a number of types of posts that aren’t value-added enough to the entire community to be posted here instead of on a coins home subreddit.

Unfortunately, professional shilling and manipulation groups use a frequent flow of low-quality posts about a coin to try and promote their interests. This action is ultimately misguided, while the goal is to promote their coin to adopt more users, their coin just becomes seen as spammy by the larger crypto community and it ends up hurting everyone involved.

In order to reduce spam and shilling attacks, we’re going to be prohibiting a number of types of posts from being standalone posts in /r/Cryptocurrency – these types of posts should now be posted in the “Daily Discussion Thread” or on a cryptocurrencies home subreddit.

(Note: These rules are considered non-exhaustive guidelines. There may be times when a post that falls into these categories is in fact relevant enough to the cryptocurrency community as a whole, in which case a moderator **may** choose at the discretion of the moderator team to allow it as a standalone post. This will be a very rare exception.)

* Public figures posting about coins on social media.
* Anyone’s holdings or portfolios other than your own.
* Individuals joining boards, foundations or as advisors. (Exceptions may be granted if prominent mainstream figures were to join a board, such as if Bill Gates changed his mind about cryptocurrencies.)
* Pre-announcements or announcement teasers.
* Foundations, teams or developers, meeting with companies, governments or agencies. (Exceptions: We will allow it if there is an official statement of a formal partnership from the company or government entity. Not from the foundation or team.)
* Foundations, teams or developers, partnering with another company. (Posts will be accepted for mainstream companies, when the partnership is formally acknowledged by the mainstream company.)
* Projects being accepted into incubators, accelerators, or startup hubs.
* Changes to logos, brand elements, or names that do not include other major newsworthy changes.
* Investments in coins, teams, projects or foundations. (Exceptions: We will allow these posts when there is an official statement or press release, from a venture capital firm, private equity firm, or mainstream investment entity (bank), confirming their investment in the project.)
* Guides on buying, configuring, mining, or trading specific coins. These are best kept in a coin specific sub-reddit.
* Companies accepting a new coin type for a payment. (Exceptions may be made for Fortune 100 companies, and unicorn startups that would signal mainstream adoption)
* Coins, tokens or projects being listed on exchanges or having new pairings listed.


**Rule Change #3 – Prohibited Posts that harm our community.**

Furthermore, while the post types above are ones that can live in the Daily Discussion Thread, there are a few more types of post that we want to clearly highlight at not welcome on /r/Cryptocurrency any more.

* Threads that attack or otherwise harass specific people or users.
* Links to blogs or crypto ""news sites"" that are low quality re-posts or aggregators of other people's content.
* Threads or posts that are aggressive attacks, or bias statements that do not promote quality discussion (Example: ""That coin sucks, it has no future!"")
* Unfounded rumors without citation.

These rules may change and evolve substantially over the coming months in order for us to strike the right balance here within /r/Cryptocurrency – we encourage you to provide your feedback about these rules in /r/Cryptocurrencymeta and help us continue to build a great community.

**Final Note:**

It’s been a bumpy few months of growing pains here at /r/cryptocurrency and we want to thank the community for their support and patience as we continue to work toward a smoother experience for everyone.

The goal of these rules is to ensure that /r/cryptocurrency continues to thrive as a place where people can come, learn about new projects, learn about industry news and get involved in thriving, detailed discussion about cryptocurrency as a community.

The attacks of shilling and FUD have harmed the cryptocurrency market as a whole. We’re far too quick to judge, and attack one another based on simply the holdings of our wallets. As a community, we’ve let ourselves be played by manipulators and we’ve allowed ourselves to forget that cryptocurrency is in its infancy still and not projects that can stand alone.

In the end, we all win when we stand together as a community, and engage in respectful and impactful discussion. We hope these rules continue to push us towards building this positive community that can be a shining example that encourages people from the mainstream to take another look at the world of cryptocurrencies.",2018-03-20 02:17:55
1537,“THE NOOBENING” – Did the cryptocurrency community really change in the recent bull-run?,Tricky_Troll,184,848snp,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/848snp/the_noobening_did_the_cryptocurrency_community/,43,"#If you don’t want to read this wall of text and just want to see the results, the [Infographic/Graph Comparison Is Here] (https://i.imgur.com/zAsGc8E.jpg)

------------------------------------------

#INTRODUCTION

Back in January, I heard much of the community complaining about the influx of noobs and how the cryptocurrency community has changed for the worse. I wanted to answer this question. **Has the community changed? And how has it changed?** Fortunately, I could answer this question quite easily. Simply repeat the Reddit cryptocurrency survey I did in October 2017 and when sharing the results, put an emphasis on comparing what has changed rather than the subreddit vs subreddit comparison I did last time.

------------------------------------------

#PURPOSE

While the main purpose of these surveys is to track changes in the reddit cryptocurrency community over the next few years, I have a specific question I wanted to answer with this most recent survey:

***Has the community changed over the last few months and is the community perception that the community has changed for the worse correct?***

The responses in the survey to the question “How do you think the reddit cryptocurrency community has changed in the last 3 months?” clearly showed that there was a general perception that the community has more noobs, more shilling and less rationality.

All of responses to this question can be seen here: https://pastebin.com/xLhfthkS (Not all the responses were serious ones)

------------------------------------------

I will break down the results summary into 3 parts before coming to the conclusion:
1. What’s Changed
2. Possible Changes*
3. Interesting Statistics

*Please note that the “possible changes” may be a result of sampling error rather than actual changes in the community and so these perceived changes should be taken with a grain of salt.

------------------------------------------

**What’s Changed:**
The proportion of cryptocurrency subreddit users who are aged 25 or under has increased from 33.2% to 43.7%.

The proportion of cryptocurrency subreddit users who found out about crypto from a friend is up from 20% to almost 29% between October 2017 to January 2018.

Less cryptocurrency subreddit users are into crypto for ideological reasons in 2018 than in 2017. The number of people in crypto for ideology dropping from 82% to 75%.

The proportion of cryptocurrency subreddit users who have invested 91-100% of their money into crypto has surprisingly dropped significantly from 18% to just 11% while the number of people who have invested less than 10% of their money has risen from 22% to 29%. It is also interesting to note that the number of people who didn’t want to share this information has dropped from 32 participants to 20, backing up the earlier conclusion that cryptocurrency subreddit users are less interested in crypto ideology such as anonymity.

The proportion of cryptocurrency subreddit users who own alt coins outside the top 10 coins by market cap (at the time of each respective poll) has risen from 61% owning such alt coins to as much as 75%.

The proportion of cryptocurrency subreddit users with alt coins outside the top 10 making up over 20% of their portfolio has risen from just 22% to 44%. It is very evident that alt coins have become much more popular.

------------------------------------------

**Possible Changes:**
There is a greater proportion of females in the space. Females now make up 7% of cryptocurrency subreddit users, up from 4.5%.

Less people consider themselves traders and more people are HODLers. 75% of cryptocurrency subreddit users consider themselves HODLers, up from 70%.

A smaller proportion of cryptocurrency subreddit users have invested in an ICO before, down from 27% who have invested to 22%.

While there has been a significant shift in the results with significantly more cryptocurrency subreddit users now being from North America and less from Europe and Asia than before, I believe that this is down to error from the method of sampling involving making posts in the daily discussion of relevant subreddits, leading to people from different timezones being more likely to see the post in peak times than others. I did however try to reduce this error by posting at approximately the same time for each survey.

------------------------------------------

**Interesting Statistics**
Over 90% of cryptocurrency subreddit users are male. (Some users even identify as attack helicopters)

83% of cryptocurrency subreddit users live in either the USA or Europe.

80% of cryptocurrency subreddit users have a university degree (a college degree for any US readers) or are currently studying at university/college to get a degree.

The most common way cryptocurrency subreddit users found out about crypto was by being told by a friend, so spread the word!

25% of cryptocurrency subreddit users consider themselves crypto traders.

24% of cryptocurrency subreddit users are not in crypto for any ideological reasons.

Most cryptocurrency subreddit users consider it likely that they would mention cryptocurrencies to a friend.

Approximately 50% of cryptocurrency subreddit users have some sort of prior experience in the stock market.

Unsurprisingly, November and December 2017 were the biggest months of growth for crypto in 2017.

When told to rate themselves on a scale of 0-10 on whether they are into crypto for the money or for the tech (0 being only money and 10 being only tech), users tend to be in crypto more for the money than the tech. However, this is only a very slight tendency.

Two thirds of cryptocurrency subreddit users have deposited an *initial investment* (not current value) in crypto valued somewhere between $501 and $20,000.

45% of cryptocurrency subreddit users have invested less than 30% of their savings into crypto. I think this is alarmingly low. However, it is possible that many people have mis-interpreted the question as how much of their current savings is in crypto rather than their initial investment. Still, I’d like to remind you all of the importance of only investing what you can afford to lose.

As of January 21st 2018 (as with all of these stats), over 80% of cryptocurrency subreddit users have made a profit from their crypto investments.

The average cryptocurrency subreddit user rates their knowledge of blockchain tech at a 6 or 7 out of 10 (10 being a comprehensive understanding).

Over 55% of cryptocurrency subreddit users say they have read a whitepaper the whole way through.

------------------------------------------

#Conclusion
As previously mentioned, around new year through til February, some of the community was showing a growing dislike towards perceived changes in the community with many people complaining about the influx of noobs who came for the money and nothing else.

**Are these complaints justified?**

**Yes** – ***Kind of.***

This survey has shown that a large portion of the community is new and has joined since November 2017, with about 20% of the community comprising of people who have joined between November 2017 and January 21st 2018. It is also evident that the community values the ideology behind crypto less than it did just 3 months prior with the number of people not in crypto for ideology rising from 17% to 24%.

So, given this trend, we know one of two things:
* The community as a whole is less bothered about the tech and ideology during bull runs due to the influx of new people.
or
* The community as a whole becomes less bothered about the tech and ideology over time due to the technology slowly becoming more mainstream.

It could also be a combination of the two above points. However, I cannot tell until I complete the next survey which will be in April. For the sake of the survey,  April will hopefully be another months of slow growth or sideways movement. This way, we can see if the “noobs” who the community seem to suggest came from the bullrun leave the community, or if they stick around/are replaced by other new community members. Depending on the results, we will be able to tell if the community is merely less bothered about blockchain tech and ideology during bullruns or if this is a long term trend where the community slowly become less interested in these things over time.

So why did I respond with “Yes – Kind of”? Because we need to be welcoming if we want to grow as a community, so we shouldn’t be complaining about them. We were all new once and why would any newcomer want to stick around in a toxic community? Even if the community isn’t what you want it to be anymore, it will change over time whether you want it to or not as cryptocurrencies can’t be a new and novel technology with insane price volatility forever.

------------------------------------------

That’s it! I will be taking this survey again 3 months after I shared the form for this one (January 21st) So keep an eye out in the daily discussion threads in r/Cryptocurrency, r/ETHTrader, r/Bitcoin and r/BitcoinMarkets around the 20th of April if you want to take part in the next survey! My aim is to keep track of the changes in this community over the next few years with this quarterly survey so that we can see how the community changes over time.

A big thank you to everyone who participated! Especially the 75 of you who filled in both of my surveys! <3 I should be back in about a month looking for responses for the third survey, so keep your eyes on the daily discussions in r/CryptoCurrency, r/ETHTrader, r/Bitcoin and r/BitcoinMarkets!

If you want more, you can see the previous survey where I did a subreddit vs subreddit comparison [here.] (https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7gid7w/the_results_of_the_big_reddit_cryptocurrency/)

I’d like to finish with the words of one of the survey participants.

> [The community is] Actively trying to kill rival Cryptocurrencies to the point that it is greatly hurting the perception of the market. *We need to be united,* even with coins we don’t personally like.

#TL;DR: 
The community *has* changed during the recent bullrun, but it seems as though people are exaggerating the problem and we need to be a welcoming community, not one which points the finger and any newcomers for “ruining the community”.

1540,"Why Robinhood is not going to ""save"" crypto in the short-term but is a great thing for crypto in the medium-long term.",deadlyturnip,65,7zbyzb,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7zbyzb/why_robinhood_is_not_going_to_save_crypto_in_the/,13,"I’ve seen too many comments in the daily discussion about how Robinhood Crypto app is going to get us out of this slump, or how it’s going to be the catalyst to push us to the next level.

While I think it’s a great step to introduce new investors into crypto people are vastly overstating it’s importance in the SHORT TERM. Here’s why:

Robinhood Crypto app will be releasing (hopefully) by the end of the month. As of the end of January, over **1.3 million people** have been waitlisted for the app. 

However, the waitlist was open to everyone from all over the world and the entire US while Robinhood will initially only allow for trading in 5 states (New Hampshire, Montana, Mass, California, Missouri). That’s a combined total population of *55 million people or 17% of the US population* (although having been to NH, MO, and MT I can tell you they probably don’t know what a Bitcoin is).

Assumptions of people living outside of the 5 states

*Note 

Row 1 one is my pessimistic view.

Row 2 is a conservative view

Row 3 is lambo moon kids view

| Percentage | New Investors| 
|----------|-------------
| 90% | ~120,000
| 75% | ~300,000
| 25% | ~900,000

The next thing, which I think is very obvious, is that most of the people who signed up for the robinhood crypto trading app are already invested into crypto. If people are claiming that this app will bring in a ton of new money, people already invested  shouldn't be included.

Again, here's a table of my assumptions of percenatge of remaining people who live outside the 5 states and are already invested



| % Invested | Remaining New Investors
|----------|-----------------------
|  80 | 24,000
|  75 | 75,000
|  25 | 225,000

So, if you're a bit more optimistic than me or want to be less conservative, then maaaybe the new investors coming into the market could be enough to change the market.

However, ALTS are the ones hemorrhaging so much, and if these people were too lazy/ didn't want to sign up for other exchanges why would Robinhood change their mind?

Furthermore, when Robinhood first started out they had strong restrictions on the amount of money you could invest. IIRC the amount you could bring in was maxed out at $10,000. I'm not going to make any assumptions about how much money each person will invest, but I can tell you it will not be too significant. 

**Now for the Good News**


1. 80% of Robinhood's users lie in the millennial of demographic (18-29 years old) with the average age being 26. 50% of the users check the app daily and 80% check the app weekly. It made stock trading accessible to everyone and its hitting the target demographic for crypto investors

2. Robinhood will over the coming months roll out the crypto trading to more states. Washington, Wyoming, and Arizona are three states that have been pro crypto and many more will follow. 

3. Robinhood is another fiat gateway. Any fiat gateway is a great thing for crypto, it makes crypto more accessible.

4. **This is the biggest one:** Robinhood has stated that they will add fiat pairings to alts. When the app releases, users will be able to monitor BCH, BTG, DASH, DOGE, ETC, LSK, LTC, XMR, NEO, OMG, QTUM, XRP, XLM, and ZEC. Hopefully this means they are intending to slowly roll out fiat pairings to all of these, which would be massive for the entire cryptosphere. More alt/fiat pairings means less BTC dominance.


I don't think this will have a big impact in the next month or two. However, overall I'm very bullish and happy about this announcement in the long-term. I think any fiat pairing gateway and successful financial company that adopts cryptocurrencies are great overall. 

**TL;DR:** ***Don't expect Robinhood's crypto app to have a big impact in the short-term. Be very excited about it long-term.***

1544,Buyers beware (beginners must read),thepeteyboy,62,7sajro,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7sajro/buyers_beware_beginners_must_read/,16,"As requested in daily discussion. Everyone needs to read this fella's- stay safe out there it is a dangerous place to be if you haven't put the research work in. NOTE: I DIDN'T DO WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY. A GUY IN A GROUP I FOLLOW DID 

If you are in this group and you are a begginer I really want you to consider this when you are investing. 

I'm not a skilled developer and in fact I know very little, to nothing, about coding. When it come to being technical, I'm the guy who refers you to my buddy lol.

Now, I've been trying to dig more into the tech behind crypto and found a lot of things VERY confusing, but, all ""technoogy"" aside, I was curious as to what creating and launching a coin really ment.

Fact is, after 1 google search and 20 minutes, I trasfersd $100 to a ETH wallet and I created a coin (SERPcoin) with a 50 million supply with a few clicks and copy and paste. https://etherscan.io/…/0xd9e2cb90c1d3af1e1506199553d6e66afb…

The entire thing took less than an hour.

Today I created a second coin as a joke (CondomCoin) with a 50 trillion supply and sent 25 trillion to someone else. https://etherscan.io/…/0xb861886107b754399b45a16332cc0cb183…

Now I really want everyone to think about the fact that a person with no real technical understanding could create a coin in under an hour. I'm sure everyone in this group probably could too following the same tutorial: https://steemit.com/…/how-to-create-your-own-ethereum-token…

My primary business is in marketing so believe me when I say, for an extra $50 to put up a website and 10k on a copywriter, I could easily launch an ico and sell a shit ton off these useless tokens promising things that don't even exist.

Its actually pretty easy to get listed on exchanged and coin market cap if you create enough hype and trading volume around your coin as well. Just meet their criteria and apply.

This is what 90% of the stuff in crypto is, nothing more than a coin that took 20 minutes to make and $100. I want everyone new in this group to realize that 99% of the promises that cryptocurrency and blockchain projects have are in things that do not exist and tech that hasn't even been developed yet.

This is why all this is so exciting but also so scary.

Before you invest in a coin do you ask who are the developers on a project? What funding do they have? Do they even have a working platform? If not, What's the application they are working for and what are their benchmarks? Is the coin actually used to power the tech or is it just a ""coin"" that has no real function?

The reason why people spend hours really digging into these coins and the projects behind them is because it's extremely important to understand the REAL risk.

If I can create a coin in 20 minutes, put up a website in an hour, and have a ico promising pipe dreams, ready to launch in a week, in a world with no rules or regulations...

Just want to make sure everyone is safe. Do your research and never invest in something yo do not 100% understand.

This IS the wild wild west and don't forget it.

1548,/r/CryptoCurrency is a Place for Quality Discussion,SamsungGalaxyPlayer,714,7pxuhh,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7pxuhh/rcryptocurrency_is_a_place_for_quality_discussion/,282,"#Unprecedented Growth

Cryptocurrencies have seen explosive growth over these past few months. Just 6 months ago, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization sat at $93 billion, and the number of /r/CryptoCurrency subscribers sat at 71,000. These have grown by **750%** and **615%** to $697 billion and 437,000, respectively. /r/CryptoCurrency has been the #1 non-default fastest-growing subreddit for most of January. It's clear the community and interest is growing, and we are excited to see the enthusiasm.

**We want to make /r/CryptoCurrency a place for quality discussion for ALL cryptocurrencies.** We do not want /r/CryptoCurrency to be dominated by a single project, or to have only low-quality content.

The moderation team has been hard at work providing important community resources and refining the subreddit rules. We would like to speak about our values, what changes we are making, and what you can do to help the mission. Frankly, we owe it to the whole ecosystem to provide a quality discussion board and resources that benefits the entire community.

Moderating a group that is growing so quickly has its challenges. We will make some mistakes along the way, but we want to be as open as possible about our processes and work with all communities.

# Values

/r/CryptoCurrency has the following values:

1. **Education**. Many people take their first dive into cryptocurrencies on our subreddit. We need to promote high-quality resources for newcomers and long-time contributors alike. The moderators are working with several subreddit teams to create quality, factual documentation for as many cryptocurrencies as possible. If you are interested in contributing towards this project, [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FCryptoCurrency) with what coins you are knowledgeable about and what experience you have.

2. **Constructive criticism and skepticism**. We highly encourage constructive criticism and skepticism in this subreddit. We want to create a culture where people are constantly asking critical questions about different projects. No coin is perfect (despite what some people will say), so we should remain critical where improvements can be made. Posts balancing cool features with honest disadvantages are much higher-quality than those which only show one side of the story.

3. **Civil discussion**. /r/CryptoCurrency is a place that is open to everyone. Posts encouraging discrimination and hate are not allowed and will result in a ban. Please report any of these posts as soon as possible so they are removed.

4. **Collaboration**. It's important that this subreddit works with other cryptocurrency subreddits.

5. **Mentorship**. Everyone starts off somewhere, and we should politely point these people in the right direction rather than ignore them. We should help these people learn more.

# Changes

To better meet these values, we are making the following changes to /r/CryptoCurrency:

1. **Maintaining our current rule of a maximum of 2 memes on the frontpage**. Of course, this means that most memes will be removed. We will encourage people who want a good laugh to post in /r/CryptoCurrencyMemes, in /r/CryptoHumor, and on Discord. In a month, we will assess if it's best to move all memes off this main subreddit.

2. **Stricter ""low-quality"" rules**. Things like ""why x is a top 10 coin"", ""why x should be worth $100"", ""why x will go to the moon"", ""why x will replace the internet"", ALL CAPS, and screenshots of portfolios/CoinMarketCap will be considered low-quality and not allowed. Exceptions could be made for high-quality news sources like Bloomberg, BBC, Reuters, etc (most cryptocurrency ""news"" sites not included). Some low-quality posts that do not meet posting requirements will still be allowed in the daily discussion.

3. **Stronger tools against brigading**. We will launch an active campaign to work with other subreddits to mandate non-participation (NP) links. Any posts that are linked elsewhere with the intent of starting a brigading campaign will be removed. Please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FCryptoCurrency) with any evidence you have against brigading.

4. **Better bots**. AutoMod is great in some ways, but it's clear that we need more. These include bots that automatically ban accounts that post referral links and hate speech.

5. **More moderators**. /r/CryptoCurrency is recruiting! If you feel you have what it takes, make a thoughtful post in /r/CryptoRecruiting. We have added 10 new moderators (including me!) in the past month.

6. **A weekly skeptics thread**. [Here's this week's](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7op0t7/weekly_skeptics_thread_january_7_2018/). This thread will be heavily moderated. Make sure to downvote and report shilling and low-quality posts. We want this thread to be filled with quality, thoughtful discussion.

7. **Increasing the post karma requirements**. The karma requirement to make new posts will be increasing. Most shilling comes from accounts with very little karma.

8. **Banning karma begging**. We do not want to see karma begging anywhere. This has been a persistent issue in the daily discussion. Instead of begging, post quality content that deserves upvotes.

9. **Sorting some threads by controversial**. This is a powerful tool that helps reduce the effect of brigading. It is often preferable to having a post completely removed. We have tested this on some posts and are still assessing if it's an improvement.

10. **Megathreads**. The moderation team will create more megathreads for important events to reduce clutter and organize the conversation.

# What You Can Do

1. **Think twice before posting**. Are you seriously posting quality content with the best title? Does your post seriously add to discussion? Does the post meet all the subreddit rules?

2. **Use the ""report"" button**. It's the best way we can spot any issues we miss.

3. **Follow rule X - communicate with the mod team**. If you disagree with something, try contacting us first. We have resolved many issues from disgruntled redditors, and it's easiest if you start calm instead of grabbing your pitchforks.

4. **Help us write documentation**! If you like a coin, why not create meaningful documentation that thousands of people will view? Quality standards apply, but we offer wide autonomy on several projects. [Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FCryptoCurrency) for more.

1555,Some important advice for newbies (x-post from Daily Discussion),prettyhappydude,19,7oe6t6,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7oe6t6/some_important_advice_for_newbies_xpost_from/,4,"To address a lot of the worrying things I'm seeing in this thread from complete investing newbies...

If you aren't prepared for the price to go down, 40, 60, or even 100% then you should not be invested in cryptocurrencies, let alone risky small cap investments. If you want to play in this space you have to be absolutely sure that when you see this happen, you don't panic, evaluate the situation as a whole, and remember what the goals of your trade were in the first place. This is partially why it's so important to invest in stuff you believe in and understand...when the weather gets bad you want to make sure you can withstand the storm because you believe it will end eventually. And if you fancy yourself a day trader, then before you get into a trade make sure you have set goals and stop losses, otherwise your floundering with no plan.

If you're putting money in thinking it's just always going to go up. Days like this are normal in all markets, and while it sucks to feel like you're losing money the ultimate lesson an investor can learn is patience. Because it seems to me many of the people who post here have never invested in other markets and expect everything to go up 100% a week. Crypto moves faster than any market, and what seems like a disaster today could be completely forgotten in three.

STOP TRADING TO FOMO. Everyone keeps asking if they should trade all their down alts to go for BTC...WHY? You're trading in your assets at a discount to buy an asset at a premium. Just because you feel like you're missing out, don't chase it. Read this thread or any other to see countless stories of people selling to chase a new coin, only to have the coin they just sold rise 50% over the next day. In crypto, if you believe in the project, hold tight. The majority of active traders lose money.

There are two types of people you can be here. For example, in a month when XLM crosses a dollar there is going to be one person saying ""thank god I bought that dip at 62"" and one person saying ""well got in at 1.01, hope this works out"". Which do you want to be?

It's a lot easier to hold something if you believe in it. So if you're just here buying coins that you don't understand with no real value, it's going to be a lot harder when you see it go down to sit tight.

You should always have some ETH and BTC in your portfolio. The fact that many of you view them as ""boring"" is extremely worrisome. A stock portfolio returning 30% in a year would be absolutely killing it, but you think that if bitcoin only goes up 100% it's a total waste. If you want to be in the crypto market, make sure you hedge a bit. As BTC goes up, Alts tend to go down.

Be careful of the excessive shilling that occurs here and on other forums. Many of the coins are shilled but for good reasons, but many more are people just trying to suckers other into buying because they are nervous they made a bad decision. With that being said, some of the coins you've been reading here a lot DO have a bright future, and can be considered ""Safer"" picks in such a crazy market, i.e. REQ VEN XMR NEO XLM. Do your research on this coins. Research the team, research the product, research the potential use cases and potential amount of users. If you believe it, buy it.

Anyone just wanted to vent and hopefully help some people from making some bad choices. Just my 2cents.",2018-01-05 21:49:48

I'm looking for a corner of the internet where discussion is focused on how this beautiful technology is changing this world. Even specific coin subreddits tend to favor memes about price above everything else. This is really a shame, considering that at this time in history we are spectating the starting line of a global revolution, and also have the opportunity to take part in the race. I hope this exists in a subreddit or other source. If not then we should start some sort of daily discussion or something of the sort. I encourage everyone here to start discussing these changes and how everyone and their grandmother can become apart of this change. Not just purchase a technology they don't understand, but teach them how cryptocurrencies are going to benefit them so so so much more then merely financially. ",2017-12-23 08:26:17

Finding sleeper coins...,newacc93250,3,7f01iw,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7f01iw/current_utility_value_vs_discounted_future/,11,"Hello everyone, I asked this question yesterday on the daily discussion and got some good feedback (Raiblocks, Syscoin, Decred), hoping to get suggestions on a couple more coins. 

Wondering if anyone has/knows of some projects that fit the following criteria:

1) Are currently trading nowhere near their ATH
2) Have a dedicated Reddit community, where the main discussion topics are technical in nature
3) Have been around for >1 year

VTC fit these three criteria a few months ago, and I left that far too soon - so based on Mr Burniske's thinking I was hoping to find other coins like this. The idea is that their price is no longer dominated by their speculative value, and is made up of a far higher proportion of current utility value.

Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated, (even if you're just shilling!)

I have set up a big cryptocurrency survey which I will share on different subreddits. The questions cover people's crypto portfolio, their demographic, crypto knowledge, crypto related sites they visit, their expertise in the crypto world, and their opinions of different cryptos and crypto related issues.

I will process the data over the next week and make graphs and stats from interesting parts from the data collected as well as sharing the raw data before sharing it on the subreddits I'm sharing the survey on.

I realize that there have been surveys on this sort of thing before, so I built off previous ones by adding new questions as well as adding questions about what subreddits people came from so we can see how opinions and stats vary by subreddits!
